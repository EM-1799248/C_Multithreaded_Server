                             GRAND FINALE

         Will with a temerity hitherto unknown in the blazing
         annals of her profession slide down an inclined rope
         350 feet high, erected on the firework platform,
         wreathed in Fizgigs and Fiery Serpents and accompanied
         by the awful thunder of a Battery of Maroons.

                          Admission 1_s_ each

           Gardens open at half-past seven, and commences at
                        Nine o’clock precisely.


“Neptune’s Grotto” was one of the many pleasure-gardens that in the
days when the Londoner was comparatively a free man helped to amuse his
leisure. Yet even by the ninth year of the reign of King George IV
most of the famous resorts of the preceding century had already been
built over, and now that Lord Grosvenor was developing the Manor of
Ebury (Buckingham Palace appearing fixed as the metropolitan abode of
the Sovereign) “Neptune’s Grotto” was likely to vanish soon and leave
no more trace of its sparkling life than the smoke of a spent rocket.
Indeed, change was already menacing. For two years Cubitt, the famous
builder, had been filling up the swampy land between Vauxhall Bridge
Road and Ranelagh with the soil he had excavated in the construction
of St. Katharine’s Docks. His cadaverous grey plastered terraces were
creeping nearer every week. Willow Walk, a low-lying footpath between
the cuts of the Chelsea Water Works, in a cottage hard by which Jerry
Abershaw and Gentleman James Maclaine the highwaymen once lodged, would
soon be turned into the haggard Warwick Street we know to-day. The
last osier bed would ultimately be replaced by the greasy aucubas of
Eccleston Square, and Lupus Street would lie heavy on ancient gardens.
The turnpike at Ebury Bridge had been gone these four years; the old
country road to Chelsea would within a lustrum be lined by houses on
either side and become Buckingham Palace Road. Even the great basin
of the Grosvenor Canal would run dry at last and breed from its mud
Victoria Station.

However, in 1829 “Neptune’s Grotto” still remained much as it had
been for over a century. The house of mellow red brick was covered
with lattice-work, which on this warm July evening was all fragrant
and ablow with climbing roses. Only the box trees had changed the
pattern of their topiary. In place of earlier warriors or statesmen you
would have found Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington at this date,
the general more freshly trimmed than the admiral, but likely to go
unpruned in the years of his unpopularity that were coming. His sacred
Majesty King George III had been allowed to sprout into the rounder
bulk of his sacred Majesty King George IV, but the new portrait was
hardly more attractive than the blowsy original. The garden paths were
bordered with stocks and hollyhocks. There were bowling-greens and
fishponds, and a dark alley in emulation of the notorious dark alley
of Vauxhall. Most of these amenities, however, had been made familiar
by a score of other pleasure-gardens all over London. What gave
“Neptune’s Grotto” its peculiar charm was the wide green lawn running
down to the edge of the great reservoir. In the middle of this was the
grotto itself, under the ferny arches of which an orchestra of Tritons
languorously invited the little world of pleasure to the waltz, or more
energetically commanded it to the gallopade. The firework platform was
built out over the water on piles; and the lawn was surrounded on three
sides by small alcoves lined with oyster shells, in some of which the
lightest footstep on a concealed mechanism would cause to spring up
a dolphin, or a mermaid, a harlequin or a Mother Shipton, startling
intruders for the maiden who first encountered them, so startling that
she would usually fling herself into the arms of the beau in escort and
require to be restored with various liquors much to the satisfaction of
Mr. Seedwell, the owner of the gardens.

High tortoiseshell combs and full curled hair, wide skirts of Gros de
Naples flounced and pinked and scalloped and fluted, white stockings
and slippers of yellow prunella, Leghorn hats of transparent crape
bound with lavender sarsenet or puffed with small bouquets of marabout,
bonnets of jonquil-yellow with waving ostrich plumes, bonnets of
marshmallow-rose with ribbons of lilac and hortensia floating loose,
double Vandyke collars of Indian muslin, grass-green parasols and
purple reticules, leg-of-mutton sleeves and satin roulades, pelisses
and pèlerines most fashionably of camelopard-yellow, ivory shoulders,
Canezon spencers and gauze capotes, fichus of ethereal-blue barège,
laughter and whispers and murmurs and music (ah, yes, no doubt and
plenty of simpers too), where now trains thunder past filled with jaded
suburbans, whose faces peep from the windows as their owners wonder
if the new film at the picture-theatre will be worth the trouble of
visiting after tea in our modish contemporary shades of nude, French
nude, sunburn, and flesh. Would that Stephenson had never cursed
humanity with his steam-engine, and would that this tale might never
creep nearer to the present than that July night of 1829! Alas, it has
more to do with the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who
fluttered out like moths in that summer dusk to watch Madame Oriano’s
fireworks; and these at whom you gaze for the moment are but creatures
in a prologue who will all be ghosts long before the last page is
written.

However, here come those ghosts, still very much alive and shilling
in hand, some from Knightsbridge, some from Chelsea, some from
Westminster. “Strombolo House,” which used to charge half-a-crown for
its fireworks, so famous were they, is closed. To be sure the “Monster”
is still open, but there are no fireworks in the entertainment there
to-night; a performing bear is all that the “Monster” can offer
to-night. The “Orange Tea Gardens” are gone for good: St. Barnabas’
Pimlico, will occupy their site, and on it cause as much religious
rowdiness in another twenty years as ever there was of secular
rowdiness in the past. “Jenny’s Whim” hard by the old turnpike has
already been covered with builder Cubitt’s beastly foundations. There
is no longer much competition with “Neptune’s Grotto” in the manor
of Ebury. A few pause in Vauxhall Bridge Road when they see the
hackney-coaches filled with merry parties bound for the most famous
gardens of all; but they decide to visit them another evening, and
they cross the road to Willow Walk, where one remembers seeing Jerry
Abershaw’s body swinging from the gibbet on Putney Common and that
scarcely thirty years ago, and another marvels at the way the new
houses are springing up all round. Some shake their heads over Reform,
but most of them whisper of pleasure and of love while ghostly moths
spin beside the path, and the bats are seen hawking against the
luminous west and the dog-star which was glimmering long before his
fellows is already dancing like a diamond in the south.

While the public was strolling on its way to “Neptune’s Grotto,” within
the gardens themselves Mr. Seedwell, the proprietor, and Madame Oriano
made a final inspection of the firework platform.

“You think she can do it?” he was saying.

“Offa coursa she can do it,” Madame replied sharply.

Mr. Seedwell shook his head in grave doubt. Weighing eighteen stone and
a bit over he found it hard to put himself in Mademoiselle Letizia’s
place.

“I don’t want an accident,” he explained. “The magistrates are only too
glad of an excuse to close us down these days.”

“Dere willa not be no accident,” Madame Oriano assured him.

And Mr. Seedwell, looking at the raven-haired and raven-beaked and
raven-eyed woman beside him, took her word for it and went off to see
that all was ready inside the house for the entertainment of his guests.

Madame Oriano squeezed a handful of her yellow satin gown.

“_Bagnato!_”[1] she murmured to herself. Then looking across to one
of the alcoves she called out in a shrill harsh voice, “Caleb! Caleb
Fuller!”

  [1] Wet.

A beetle could not have left his carapace more unwillingly than
Caleb Fuller that alcove. He was a young man—certainly not more than
twenty-five, perhaps not as much—whose lumpish and pasty face suggested
at first an extreme dulness of mind until one looked a little closer
and perceived a pair of glittering granite-grey eyes that animated the
whole countenance with an expression that passed beyond cunning and
touched intelligence. Beside the dragon-fly vividness of his employer
he appeared, as he shambled across the lawn to hear what she wanted of
him, like an awkward underground insect, with his turgid rump and thin
legs in tight pantaloons and his ill-fitting tail-coat of rusty black.

“Dissa English cleemat _non è possibile_,” Madame shrilled. “Everyting
willa be wet before we beginna to fire.”

“It’s the heavy dew,” said Caleb.

“Oh, _diavolo_! What do it matter which it is, if de fireworks will
alla be—how you say—spilt?”

“Spoilt,” he corrected gloomily.

“_Che lingua di animali, questa_ English linguage! Where issa John
Gumm?”

“In the tap-room,” Caleb informed her.

“Drinking! Drinking,” she shrilled. “Why you don’ta to keep him notta
to drink before we are finished?”

John Gumm who was Madame’s chief firer had already imperilled by his
habits several of her performances.

“Somebody musta go and putta clothes on de fireworks. _Non voglio che
abbiamo un fiasco_,[2] I don’ta wish it. You hear me, Caleb?”

  [2] “I do not want us to have a fiasco.”

Caleb was used to these outbursts of nervous anxiety before every
display, and on most evenings he would have humoured Madame by bullying
the various assistants and have enjoyed giving such an exhibition of
his authority. But this evening he would not have been sorry to see the
damp air make the whole display such a fiasco as Madame feared, for
he bitterly resented the public appearance of Letizia Oriano, not so
much for the danger of the proposed feat, but for the gratification the
sight of her shapely legs would afford the crowd. In fact when Madame
had summoned him to her side, he was actually engaged in a bitter
argument with Letizia herself and had even gone so far as to beg her to
defy her mother and refuse to make the fire-clad descent.

“There won’t be enough dew to prevent the firing,” he argued. “And
more’s the pity,” he added, gathering boldness as jealousy began once
more to rack him. “More’s the pity, I say, when you’re letting your
only child expose her—expose herself to danger.” He managed to gulp
back the words he just lacked the courage to fling at her, and though
his heart beat “Jezebel! Jezebel!” he dared not say it out.

“Dere is nottings dangerous,” she snapped. “She has walked the slacka
rope and the tighta rope since she was a _bambina_. Her fazer has
learnt her to do it.”

Caleb groaned within himself. Letizia’s father was as mythical and as
many-sided as Proteus. Italian prince, English nobleman, play-actor,
ballet-master, acrobat, with as many aliases as a thief, he was
whatever Madame chose he should be to suit her immediate argument.
Nobody knew his real name or his real profession. Once, when Caleb had
remonstrated with her for being apparently willing to sell Letizia to a
rich and snivelling old rake, she had actually dared to argue that she
was better capable of guarding her daughter’s virtue than anybody else
because the father of her had been a cardinal. Caleb, who was sick with
love for Letizia and sick with hate for Popery, was near losing his
reason. Luckily, however, the old suitor fell into a hopeless palsy,
and since then Madame’s financial affairs had prospered sufficiently
to make her independent of Letizia’s cash value. That her affairs had
prospered was largely due to Caleb himself, who, entering her service
as a clerk when he was hardly nineteen, had lost no time in gathering
into his own plump white hands the tangled skeins of the business so
that he might unravel them at his own convenience without ever again
letting them go.

Madame Oriano had been glad enough to put the financial side of the
business in Caleb’s hands, for, having inherited from her father,
Padua’s chief artist in pyrotechny, a genuine passion for inventing
new effects, she devoted herself to these with renewed interest, an
interest moreover that was no longer liable to be interrupted by
amours. She had grown gaunt and her temper, never of the sweetest,
had long made her an impossible mistress for any man however young
be might be. At the age of sixteen she had eloped from her father’s
house in Padua with an English adventurer. After a year of doubtful
bliss he had left her stranded in a Soho garret with a cageful of
love-birds and twenty pairs of silk stockings—he had intended these
as a present for the schoolgirl he was planning to abduct, but in the
confusion of escaping from his old sweetheart he had left them behind
him. Maria Oriano entered upon a period of fortune-telling, then went
into partnership with an Italian pyrotechnist to whom with intervals
of amorous escapades she remained loyal for ten years, in fact till he
died, after which she carried on the business in her own name. Letizia
was born when her mother was approaching forty, and since neither
Letizia nor anybody else ever discovered who the father was, it may
safely be assumed that Madame really did not know herself which of her
lovers might be congratulated. She had a dozen in tow about this time.
No solution of the mystery had ever been provided by Letizia herself,
who now, at seventeen, was the image of her own mother when she, a
year younger, ran away from Padua, a dark and slim and supple and
lustrous-eyed young termagant.

There she was now, fretfully tapping the floor of the alcove with her
dainty foot and wondering what her mother could want with Caleb. It
was not that she wanted Caleb so much for herself, not at any rate
for the pleasure of his conversation. But she was used to quarrelling
with him, and she missed his company much as a child might miss a toy
that it could maltreat whenever it was in the mood to do so. She might
laugh at his awkward attempts to make love to her, but she would have
been piqued by his indifference, piqued and puzzled by it as she would
have been puzzled by the failure of her spaniel to wag its tail when
she entered a room. There was Caleb bowing and scraping to her mother
(who looked a pretty sight in that yellow satin gown) while she who
after all was this evening indubitably _the_ attraction was left alone
in this dull alcove without so much as a glass of champagne to sip.
How much would her mother worry about the dampness of the fireworks,
were she to announce that she could not make the descent that was to
bring the display to such a grand conclusion? It would serve them all
right if she did rebel. They would appreciate her much more were she
sometimes to assert herself. Letizia pulled open the cloak of light
blue velvet that she was wearing over her costume and contemplated her
slim legs and the beautifully unwrinkled tights. The upper part of her
dress consisted of an abbreviated tunic of asbestos round which the
unlit fireworks coiled like blue snakes.

“Or sausages,” murmured Letizia resentfully. “If I did not look like
Guy Fawkes and if it were a little darker, I’d put on a mask and have
such fun amongst the crowd. Oh gemini, wouldn’t I just!”

She jumped up in a fit of impatience. Her foot pressed the concealed
mechanism in the floor of the alcove, and immediately there sprang up
before her a life-size Mother Shipton, quivering all over and shaking
her steeple hat, and seeming in the twilight most horribly real.

“Gesù Maria, Giuseppe!” she shrieked, crossing herself in an agony of
terror.

Caleb, whose first thought was that some young buck was trying to kiss
Letizia, paid no more attention to Madame Oriano’s complaints of Gumm’s
drunkenness and the dewy nightfall, but plunged off to the rescue,
splitting the seat of his pantaloons in an effort to move his clumsy
legs really fast.

“Oh gemini, Caleb, the Devil’s been sitting beside me all the time and
I never knew it,” Letizia cried, when she saw him.

“I make no doubt he has,” said Caleb in lugubrious agreement. “But this
ain’t him. This ain’t no more than one of those fortune-telling figures
you’ll see at fairs. That’s what they call fun, that is,” he groaned.

“It sprang up so sudden, Caleb. The Devil couldn’t have sprung up no
faster. Oh gemini, it set me off praying, Caleb.”

“Praying!” he scoffed. “I wouldn’t give much for you if the Devil did
come to take you, and you had to trust to your prayers.”

“It’s made my heart thump, Caleb. Only feel how fast it beats.”

The young man snatched his hand away from her.

“Hussy! Nought would please you so well as to lead me on into sin.”

It was Caleb’s heart that was beating now, so fast indeed that he
turned in desperation to strike down the puppet that seemed to be
leering at him like an old bawd in a dark entry.

“Oh, you sicken me,” she pouted. “I’ll surely never have the courage to
mount to the top of the mast now. At least, I won’t unless I have some
champagne, Caleb.”

There was no answer.

“Did you hear me, Caleb?” she pressed softly. “I said champagne.”

He turned his back and feigned not to hear. But a passing waiter heard
and came into the alcove, rubbing his hands in anticipation of serving
them.

“Champagne, Caleb.”

“Yes, ma’am. Certainly, ma’am.”

“No,” Caleb shouted.

The waiter inclined his head in sarcastic acknowledgment.

“And light the lamp,” Caleb told him.

Above the circular stone hung a great green globe painted over with
fish, which when lighted up shed a kind of subaqueous sheen upon the
alcove.

“And the champagne, sir?” the waiter asked.

“Bring a bottle quickly,” Letizia commanded with a laugh of mockery.

“Bring nothing at all,” cried Caleb, swinging round on his heels in a
rage.

“Oh gemini, Caleb,” Letizia cried. “Your handkerchief’s falling out of
your pocket.”

She grabbed at it, and pulled out the tail of his shirt.

Letizia flung herself into a chair, clapping her hands and throwing
her legs into the air in a very ecstasy of delight.

“Oh gemini, Mr. Waiter; bring two bottles,” she cried. “And a needle
and a thread, for I’ll burst my own trunks next and never dare stand on
a chair, let alone come sliding down to the ground from a mast.”

The waiter departed to obey her commands, a wide grin on his insolent
face.

“Listen to me, Letizia,” Caleb cried in a rage, seizing her wrist.
“I’ll pay for not one drop of champagne, d’ye hear me? Little Jezebel
that you are! You love to make me suffer for your wantonness. I was
pure till your Popish gipsy eyes crossed mine and turned them to
thoughts of sin. Isn’t it enough that you’re going to mount that
accursed firework platform for every gay young sprig to stare at you
carnally and gloat on your limbs and lust after you? Isn’t it enough, I
say, for one evening?”

“You’re a fine one to accuse me of making myself a show,” she retorted,
wresting herself from his grasp. “And you with the tail of your shirt
sticking out of your breeches! You’d better call it your flag of truce,
Caleb, and cry peace.”

“I’ll make no peace with you, young Jezebel, in this wanton humour.”

“Why then, catch me if you can, Mr. Preacher, for I’ll have my
champagne, and Mr. Devil can pay for it, if you won’t.”

With this she stood mocking him from the lawn outside.

“Come back,” he groaned, the sweat all beady on his forehead.

“I won’t come back neither,” laughed Letizia, pirouetting.

“Pull your cloak round you, shameless minx.”

“No, and I won’t do that, neither.”

She flung it farther from her and taunted him with the sight of her
legs so slim and so shapely in the light blue silk.

“You dursn’t run after me, Caleb, or you’ll be taken to Bedlam for a
lunatic when the people see you running after me like a draggle-tailed
duck. Quack-quack, Caleb! I’m the grand finale to-night, and if you
won’t give me champagne I’ll find some one who will, and he’ll have the
grandest finale of all.”

Unfortunately for Letizia when she turned round to run away she ran
into her mother, who caught her by the ear and led her back into the
alcove.

“_Sei pazza?_” she demanded.

“If I am mad, it’s his fault,” protested Letizia angrily. “Let go of my
ear, mamma! You’re hurting me.”

“_Vuoi far la putanella, eh?_”[3] cried Madame Oriano furiously,
squeezing her daughter’s ear even harder.

  [3] “You want to play the little wanton, eh?”

“Eh, _basta_,[4] mamma! Or I’ll be no grand finale to-night for you or
nobody else. I only asked for champagne because that old witch jumped
up out of the floor and frightened me. If you hadn’t been screaming so
loud yourself, you might have heard me scream.”

  [4] Enough.

“_Insolente_,” cried Madame, making coral of her daughter’s ivory
cheeks with several vicious slaps.

Luckily for Letizia the waiter came back at this moment with a tray on
which were glasses and the bottle of champagne. This gave Madame Oriano
a real opportunity. Picking up her skirt as if she were going to drop a
curtsey, she raised one foot and kicked the tray and its contents up to
the oyster-inlaid ceiling of the alcove. She might have been giving the
signal for the fireworks to begin, for just as the contents of the tray
crashed to the ground the thunder of the maroons reverberated about the
pale sapphire of the nine o’clock sky.

Madame hurried out into the excited crowd of spectators, clapping her
skinny hands and crying, “_Bravo! Bravimissimo!_” at the top of her
voice. She believed in the power of the claque and always led the
applause of her own creations. Immediately after the maroons the Bengal
light flared and turned the upturned faces of the crowd to a lurid
rose, the glassy waters of the basin to garnets. Letizia, who had been
sobbing with pain and fury while the maroons were exploding, responded
with all her being to the excitement of the Bengal light. She forgot
her pain, her rage, her disappointment. She quivered like the Mother
Shipton, became like the puppet a mere dressed-up spring. She longed
for the moment when she should be summoned to ascend the platform and
climb the mast to the crow’s-nest on the summit, and most of all for
the moment she should hear the sausages round her asbestos tunic fizz
and cackle and spit, and when wreathed in flames, balancing herself
with a flashing Italian streamer in each hand, she should slide down
the long rope into the tumultuous cheers of the public below.

Caleb was aware of her eagerness and, having in himself nothing of the
mountebank, supposed that she was merely longing to display her legs to
the mob. He vented the bile of his jealousy upon the waiter.

“I’ll report you to Mr. Seedwell,” he stormed. “How dare you bring
champagne without an order?”

“Madame....”

“Get out of here,” Caleb shouted. “This is no madam, you lousy wretch.
I’ll have no rascals like you come pimping round this young lady.”

Sky rockets were shedding their fiery blossoms upon the air, and the
water below was jewelled with their reflections. Tourbillions leapt up
to tremble for a moment in golden spirals. Mutation followed mutation
as shivered wheels of rubies turned to fountains of molten emeralds and
amethysts and blazing showers of topaz. Above the explosions, above
the applause, the shrill voice of Madame Oriano rang out continually,
“_Bravo! Bravissimo! Ancora! Bene! Benissimo! Che Splendore! Che
magnificenza!_”

Letizia stood rapt like a saint that expects a corporeal assumption to
the seventh heaven.

“It’s time I went up,” she breathed.

“Not yet,” Caleb pleaded, in horror of the moment when that lewd and
accursed mob should gloat upon her slim form.

“It is. It is! Let me go, Caleb! Gemini, you crazy fool, you’ll make me
late.”

Letizia sprang away from his detaining arms.

“Why don’t you set fire to your shirt, Caleb, and slide down behind
me?” she called back to him in mockery.

There were shouts of enthusiasm when the figure of Letizia stood up
dimly against the stars. Followed a silence. Old John Gumm fired the
fizgigs and the serpents. With a shriek of triumphant joy Letizia
launched herself from the mast. High above the wondering murmurs of the
crowd her mother’s voice resounded.

“_Che bella ragazza!_[5] _Brava! Bravissima! Avanti, figlia mia! Che
forma di Venere!_”[6]

  [5] “What a lovely girl!”
  [6] “Forward, my daughter! What a figure of Venus!”

“Almighty God,” Caleb groaned. “She might be naked.”

When the flaming vision touched earth, he rushed forward to recapture
it; but Letizia, intoxicated with success, flung herself into the arms
of three or four young bucks who were waiting to carry her off to
champagne, while from the grotto in the middle of the lawn the Triton
orchestra struck up Weber’s seductive _Invitation to the Waltz_.




                              CHAPTER II

                              THE FACTORY


Caleb was in such a turmoil of jealous agitation for several hours
after the grand finale as to be almost beside himself; and although
Madame Oriano, in high good humour over the success of the fireworks,
offered to sew up the split in his pantaloons, she could not sew up the
rents that Letizia’s behaviour was tearing in her manager’s peace of
mind. Once he ventured to approach the alcove where she sat drinking
and flirting with half-a-dozen hopeful courtiers, and asked her to
come with him. Letizia shrieked with laughter at such a notion and
shrieked louder when her companions began to pelt Caleb with crusts of
bread; and maybe she would not have laughed much less loudly if they
had gone on to pelt him with bottles as they threatened they would do
unless he quickly took himself off and ceased to annoy them. Caleb, to
do him justice, would not have cared a jot if he could have rescued
Letizia from their company at the cost of a broken crown; but he did
not want to expose himself to the mortification of being vanquished
and, since he felt positive that this could be the only result of his
intervention, he retreated to brood over his wrongs in a secluded
arbour, from which he had the minor satisfaction of driving away the
amorous couples that in turn hopefully sought its dark protection
throughout that warm and starry July night.

Was Madame Oriano dependent enough yet upon his help in the business
to insist on her daughter’s marrying him? That was the question. Caleb
felt convinced that she would not object, but if the little hussy
herself refused, would her mother compel her? Brought up in the
egocentric gloom of an obscure Protestant sect known as the Peculiar
Children of God, Caleb’s first thought was always the salvation of
his own soul. This, as often happens, had become a synonym for the
gratification of his own desires. He desired Letizia. Therefore he must
have her, or his soul would be imperilled. What she felt about it was
of little importance. Besides, she so clearly had in her the makings of
a wanton that it was his duty to save her soul as well, which he had
every reason to suppose he should be able to do could he but safely
secure her for a wife. The state of affairs could not continue as it
was at present. His imagination must not remain for ever the tortured
prey of carnal visions. Letizia’s white neck ... Letizia’s girlish
breasts ... Letizia’s red alluring lips ... Letizia’s twining fingers
... and at this moment in the alcove those drunken sons of Belial
were gloating upon her.... No, it could not go on like this! She must
be his with God’s benign approval. Caleb sat for an hour, two hours,
three hours maybe, in a dripping trance of thwarted passion, burning as
fiercely with the hot itch of jealousy as if he had actually been flung
into a steaming nettle-bed.

Dawn, a lucid primrose dawn, was bright beyond the towers of Lambeth
Palace when the hackney-coach with Madame Oriano, Letizia, and Caleb
went jogging homeward over Westminster Bridge. Even now, though Letizia
had fallen deliciously asleep on his shoulder, Caleb was not at peace,
for the semioctagonal turrets which were set at intervals along the
parapet to serve as refuges for the homeless, reminded him of the
alcoves at “Neptune’s Grotto,” and his mind was again tormented by the
imagination of her behaviour that night. She reeked too, of wine, in
this fresh morning air. He shook her roughly:

“Wake up! We’re nearly home.”

Madame Oriano was snoring on the opposite seat.

“Why don’t you poke mamma like that?” Letizia cried out resentfully.

An impulse to crush her to his heart surged over Caleb, but he beat
off the temptation, panting between desire of her and fear for himself.
Kisses would forge no chain to bind this wanton, and he, should he
once yield to kissing her, would be led henceforth by a Delilah. The
hackney-coach jogged on into the Westminster Road.

Madame Oriano’s factory consisted of the unused rooms in an ordinary
York Street dwelling-house. Special precautions to isolate the
dangerous manufacture were practically unknown at this date. All
firework-making by an Act of Dutch William was still illegal, and from
time to time prosecutions of pyrotechnists were set on foot at the
instigation of the magistrates when the boys of a neighbourhood became
too great a nuisance on the Fifth of November. Inasmuch, however, as
firework displays were a feature of coronations, peace declarations,
births of royal heirs, and other occasions of public rejoicing, the
Law adopted then as ambiguous an attitude as it does now in this early
twentieth century, toward betting. Until Caleb arrived in London from
the Cheshire town where he had been born and bred, Madame Oriano
produced her fireworks in fits and starts of inventive brilliance that
were symbolical of the finished product. Most of her workmen were
habitual drunkards. No kind of attempt was made to run the business
side with any financial method. From time to time the proprietress put
a card in the window advertising her need for an accountant. Clerks
came and clerks went until she began to look on the whole class as no
better than predatory nomads. It was in answer to one of these cards in
her window that Caleb presented himself. His conscience troubled him at
first when he found with what mountebank affairs firework-making was
likely to bring him into contact, but he was seized by a missionary
fervour and began to devote all his energy to making the business
respectable. Only John Gumm, the chief firer, managed to survive
Caleb’s cleansing zeal. The rest of the drunken workmen were sacked
one after another, and their places taken wherever it was possible
by young lads and girls that Caleb procured from the poorhouse. The
long hours and bad food he inflicted upon these apprentices seemed to
bring the business nearer to genuine respectability. It showed sound
economy, and the most censorious Puritan could not discover in those
workrooms filled with listless children anything that pandered to the
gratification of human pleasure. One could feel that when the fireworks
left the factory there was nothing against their morality. Their
explosion under the direction of Madame Oriano and drunken John Gumm
was of course regrettably entertaining, but the rest of the business
was impeccably moral. Not only did Caleb attend to the accounts, to the
management of the workers, and to the judicious purchase of materials,
but he also studied the actual art of pyrotechny, and early this
very year he had discovered how to apply chlorate of potash to the
production of more brilliant colours than any that had hitherto been
seen. He had not yet revealed this discovery to Madame Oriano, because
he was planning to use the knowledge of it as a means of persuading her
to insist on Letizia’s marrying him. She would be so much astonished by
the green he had evolved by combining nitrate of baryta with chlorate
of potash that she would give him anything he demanded. And as for the
red he could now produce by adding nitrate of strontia to his chlorate
of potash, why, if such a red could only be bought in the ultimate
depths of Hell, Madame would have to buy.

The hackney-coach drew up in front of the dingy house in York Street,
and by the time Caleb had done arguing with the driver about his fare
mother and daughter had tumbled into bed. In spite of the nervous
strain he had been enduring all night Caleb could not make up his
mind to go to sleep himself. He was indeed feeling very much awake.
It was now full day. The sunlight was glinting on the grimy railings
of the area, and the footsteps of early workers shuffled past along
the pavement at intervals. Caleb looked round the room and frowned at
the tools lying idle on the tables and benches. He was filled with
indignation at the thought that all those misbegotten apprentices
should be snoring away these golden hours of the morning in their
garret. He was too lenient with them, far too lenient. It would do
the brats good to be awakened a little earlier than usual. He was up
and dressed; why should they still be snoring? The back of his mind,
too, itched with an evil desire to make somebody pay for what he had
suffered last night. Caleb set off upstairs to rouse the apprentices.
As he drew near the bedroom where Madame Oriano and Letizia slept
together in that gilded four-poster which so much revolted his sense
of decency, Caleb paused, for the door was wide open. He tried to keep
his face averted while he hurried past; but his will failed him and,
turning, he beheld the vision of Letizia, so scantily wrapped in her
cloak of sky-blue that her white body appeared as shamelessly unclad as
the vicious little Cupids that supported the canopy of the bed. Caleb
staggered back. Had there been a knife in his hand, he might have cut
Letizia’s throat, such an intolerable loathing of her beauty seized
him. He rushed madly past the open door, and a moment or two afterwards
he stood in the garret, surveying with hate the sleeping forms of the
apprentices. A sunbeam glinting through the broken lattice of the
dormer lit up the four flushed faces, spangled the hair of the youngest
and fairest, and for Caleb pointed at the spectacle of brazen sloth.

“Get up, you charity brats,” he shouted, pulling off the dirty
coverlet. “Get up and work, or I’ll report you to the overseers for
incorrigibles.”

The children sat up in bed dazed by this sudden awakening.

“Don’t loll there, rubbing your eyes and staring at me,” Caleb snarled.
“If you aren’t downstairs and hard at work on those composition stars
in five minutes, I’ll see what a good flogging will do for you.”

From the boys’ garret Caleb went across to visit the girls’.

“Get down to your scissors and paste, you lazy hussies,” he bellowed in
the doorway.

The little girls, the eldest of whom was hardly twelve, sat up in a
huddle of terror. The shift of the youngest, who might be ten, was torn
so that her bare shoulder protruded to affront Caleb’s gaze. He strode
into the room and struck the offending few inches of skin and bone.

“Will nothing teach you modesty?” he gibbered. “Aren’t you afraid of
burning in Hell for your wickedness? Shame on you, I say. Have you no
needle and thread, Amelia Diggle? You ought to be whipped, and I hope
Madame will whip you well. Now stop that blubbering and dress yourself,
and in five minutes let me find you all hard at work.”

Caleb retired to his own bedroom, where after a miserly use of soap
and water he changed out of his rusty black evening clothes into the
drab of daily life. He was then able to bend down and say his prayers,
partly because the drab breeches were not as tight as the black
pantaloons and partly because they did not show the dust so easily.

In contemplating Caleb while he is kneeling to ask his savage deity to
give him Letizia and to bless his discovery of chlorate of potash as a
colour intensifier and to fructify his savings and to visit His wrath
upon all unbelievers, one may feel that perhaps it was being unduly
sentimental last night, a trifle wrought upon by music and starshine
and coloured lamps, to wish that this tale might remain in the year of
grace 1829.

Caleb rose from his knees and, fortified by his prayers, succeeded this
time in passing the open door of Letizia’s bedroom without so much as
one swift glance within. He came down to the basement and with a good
deal of complacency gloated over the sight of those children all so
beautifully hard at work. He would have liked to tell them how lucky
they were to be in the care of somebody who took all this trouble to
rouse them early and teach them the joys of industry. The thought of
how many more composition stars would be made to-day than were made
yesterday was invigorating. He regarded the tousled heads of the
apprentices with something like good-will.

“That’s the way, boys, work hard and well and in three hours you’ll be
enjoying your breakfast,” he promised. Then suddenly he looked sharply
round the room. “Why, where’s Arthur Wellington?”

At this moment the foundling thus christened, a fair-haired child of
eleven, appeared timidly in the doorway, and shrank back in terror when
his master demanded where he had been.

“Please, Mr. Fuller, I was looking for my shoe,” he stammered,
breathing very fast.

“Oh, you were looking for your shoe, were you, Arthur Wellington? And
did you find your shoe?”

“No, Mr. Fuller,” the boy choked. “I think it must have fell out of the
window.”

His blue eyes were fixed reproachfully, anxiously, pleadingly, on Joe
Hilton the eldest apprentice who bent lower over his task of damping
with methylated spirit the composition for the stars, the while he
managed to scowl sideways at Arthur.

“So you’ve been loitering about in your room while your companions have
been hard at work, Arthur Wellington?”

“I haven’t been loitering. I’ve been looking for my shoe.”

“Contradict me, will you, Arthur Wellington?” said Caleb softly. “Show
me your other shoe. Come nearer, Arthur. Nearer. Take it off and give
it to me.”

The boy approached, breathing faster; but he still hesitated to take
off the shoe.

“Don’t keep me waiting, Arthur,” Caleb said. “You’ve kept me waiting
long enough this lovely summer morning. Give me the shoe.”

Arthur did as he was told.

“Don’t go away, Arthur Wellington. I’m talking to you for your good.
This lovely summer morning, I said. Perhaps you didn’t hear me? Eh?
Perhaps you’re deaf? Deaf, are you, you workhouse brat?”

Caleb gripped the boy’s puny shoulder and banged him several times on
the head with the shoe.

“Perhaps you won’t be so deaf when I’ve knocked some of the deafness
out of you,” he growled. “Blubbering now, eh, you miserable little
bastard? Look up, will you! Look up, I say! Oh, very well, look down,”
and Caleb pushed the boy’s head between his own legs and thrashed
him with the first weapon that came to hand, which was a bundle of
rocket-sticks.

“Button yourself up, Arthur Wellington,” said Caleb, when he had
finished with him and flung him to the floor where he lay writhing
and shrieking and unbraced. “If I were you, Arthur Wellington, I’d be
ashamed to make such an exhibition of myself in front of girls. That’s
enough! Stop that blubbering. Do you hear? Stop it, and get to work.
Stop it, will you, Arthur Wellington, unless you want another thrashing
twice as bad.”

One of the apprentices was placing the stars on the fender to dry them
before the fire which Caleb had lighted to make himself the tea.

“Be careful, Edward Riggs, not to put those stars too close, or you’ll
be having an accident.”

“They’re all right where they are, aren’t they, Mr. Fuller?”

“Yes, as long as you’re careful,” said Caleb. “Now I’m going upstairs
to my office to work. We all have our work to do, you know. And if I
hear any laughing or chattering down here, I’ll make some of you see
more stars than you’ll ever make in a week.”

One of the girls managed to titter at this and was rewarded by one of
Caleb’s greasy smiles. Then he left the apprentices to their work and
went into the question of accounts, hidden in his sanctum, which was on
the first floor and hardly bigger than a powder-closet. Indeed, Caleb’s
high stool and desk with two ledgers and an iron box chained to a
staple in the floor filled it so nearly full that when the manager was
inside and hard at work nobody could get in unless he squeezed himself
into the corner. Caleb’s expressed object in keeping Madame Oriano’s
books so meticulously was that if at any moment a purchaser came along
with a firm offer for the business, lock, stock, and barrel, he would
obtain a better price for it. It was useless for the owner to protest
that no inducement or offer of any kind would tempt her into a sale,
Caleb insisted. He was as always outwardly subservient to his mistress,
but he insisted. And she would tire of arguing with him when she had
fired off a few Italian oaths and shrugged her shoulders in contempt of
such obstinacy.

“Besides,” Caleb used to point out, “so long as I keep my books
properly, anybody can see my honesty. If I kept no books, people would
be saying that I was robbing you.”

“I would notta believe them.”

“No, you mightn’t believe them until you were angry with me about
something else; but you might believe it then, and I shouldn’t care to
be accused of robbing you. It would hurt me very deeply, ma’am.”

As a matter of fact Caleb had robbed Madame Oriano with perfect
regularity for the last five years. The humble savings, to which from
time to time with upturned eyes he would allude, were actually the
small clippings and parings he had managed to make from her daily
profits. He did not feel the least guilt in thus robbing her, for not
merely could he claim that he was the only person who did rob her
nowadays, but he could also claim that these robberies practically
amounted to the dowry of her daughter. It was not as if the money
were going out of the family. Whether, in the event of his failing to
marry Letizia, Caleb would have made the least reparation is doubtful.
He would have found another excuse for his behaviour. One of his
principles was never to admit even to his tribal deity that he had
been or was wrong. He could imagine nothing more corruptly humiliating
than the Popish habit of confession. On the other hand, he was always
willing to admit that he was liable to err, and he always prayed most
devoutly to be kept free from temptation.

In his dusty little office that morning the various emotions to which
he had been subjected since yesterday began to react at last upon
Caleb’s flabby body. Leaning forward upon his desk, he put his head
down upon his folded arms and fell into a heavy sleep.

He was awakened by a series of screams, and jumping off his stool
he hurried out into the passage just as one of the girl apprentices
enveloped in flames came rushing up the stairs from the basement. He
tried to stop her from going higher, but she eluded him, and as she
went flashing up the stairs toward the upper part of the house she
screamed:

“It was Arthur Wellington done it! Don’t laugh at him, Joe Hilton.
Don’t laugh at him no more, or he’ll throw the stars on to the fire.
Where’s a window? Where’s a window?”

The wretched child vanished from sight, and the moment after a ghastly
scream announced that she had found a window and flung herself from it
into the street.

Letizia’s spaniel came barking down from the room above. Simultaneously
there was a frenzied knocking on the front door, flashes and crashes
everywhere, smoke, more shrieks of agony, and at last a deafening
explosion. It seemed to Caleb that the whole house was falling to
pieces on top of him, as indeed when he was dragged out of the ruins he
found that it had.




                              CHAPTER III

                             THE PROPOSAL


Accidents in firework factories occurred so often in those days, when
the law had not yet recognised gunpowder as a means to provide popular
diversion and taken steps in the Explosives Act to safeguard its
employment, that for six poorhouse children to lose their lives and for
two others to be permanently maimed was hardly considered as serious as
the destruction of two comparatively new houses in York Street. Madame
Oriano’s own escape was voted miraculous, especially when it was borne
in mind that both her legs had to be amputated; and while some pointed
out that if she had not been sleeping in that florid four-post bed she
need not have had her legs crushed by the canopy, others were equally
quick to argue that it was precisely that canopy which saved the rest
of her body from being crushed as completely as her legs. The bed
certainly saved Letizia.

The accident was attributed to the inhuman carelessness of a parish
apprentice known as Arthur Wellington, whereby he had placed a
composition star on the hob of a lighted fire in order to dry it more
expeditiously before being rammed into the casing of a Roman candle.
Caleb in his evidence suggested that parish apprentices were inclined
to make up for lost time in this abominable way. Everybody shook his
head at the wickedness of parish apprentices, but nobody thought of
blaming Caleb for the arrangement of a workroom that permitted such a
dangerous method of making up for lost time. As for Caleb himself, when
he had recovered from the shock of so nearly finding himself in Heaven
before he had planned to retire there from the business of existence,
he began to realise that the destruction of the factory was the best
thing that could have happened for an earthly future that he hoped long
to enjoy. He took the first opportunity of laying before Madame Oriano
his views about that future. Should his proposal rouse her to anger,
he could feel safe, inasmuch as she could certainly not get out of bed
to attack him and was unlikely to leave the hospital for many weeks to
come.

“Well, I willa always say dissa one ting, my friend, and datta is I
have never had no _esplosione_ in alla my life before dissa one. Such
_fortuna_ could never last for ever, I am secure. My legs, they makka
me a little bad, datta is all.”

Caleb regarded his mistress where she was lying in bed looking like a
sharp-eyed bird in tropical vegetation, under the gaudy satin coverlet
of her four-poster which she had insisted on having mended and brought
to the hospital.

“I’m sure we ought all of us to be very thankful to our Father Who put
His loving arms around us and kept us safe,” he oozed.

Madame Oriano, become an old lady since her accident, smiled grimly.

“_Peccato che Nostro Padre non ha pensato per mie povere gambe!_” she
muttered.

“What did you say?” Caleb asked timidly. He could never quite rid his
mind of the fancy that the Italian language had a dangerous magic, an
abracadabral potency which might land him in Hell by merely listening
to it.

“I say it issa damn pity He does not putta His arms around my legs. Dat
is what I say, Caleb.”

“He knows best what is good for us,” Caleb gurgled, turning up his eyes
to the ceiling.

“_Può essere_,” the old lady murmured. “Perraps He do.”

“But what I’ve really come to talk about,” Caleb went on, “is the
future of the business. Your presence, of course, will be sadly missed;
but you’ll be glad to hear that I have managed to fulfil all our
engagements up to date, though naturally with such a terrible loss of
material the profits will be small—dreadfully small.”

No doubt Caleb was right, and even what profit there was he probably
put in his iron box which had comfortably survived the destruction of
the factory.

“I don’ta aspect no profit,” said Madame Oriano.

“But I have been turning things over in my mind,” Caleb pressed,
“and I hope very much that you will be pleased with the result of
my—er—turnings. Yes, I’m hoping that very much indeed.” Caleb took a
deep gulp before he went on, staring away out across the chimney-stacks
to escape the old lady’s arched eyebrows.

“Madame Oriano, when I came to London six years ago and entered your
service, you were a mother to me. I can never forget your beautiful
maternal behaviour, ma’am, and, oh, ma’am, I am so anxious to be a son
to you now in the hour of your trouble—a true son.”

“You never could notta be a son for me, Caleb. _Siete troppo grasso,
caro._ You are too big. How you say? Too fat.”

“Ah, Madame Oriano, don’t say you won’t let me be a son to you till
you’ve heard all I have to tell you. I want to marry your daughter,
ma’am. I want to marry your Letizia. I loved her from the first moment
I set eyes on her, although of course I knew my position too well to
allow myself to indulge in any hopes that would have been wanting
in respect to my employer. But I have worked hard, ma’am. Indeed,
I venture to think that my love for your daughter is not near so
presumptuous at this moment as it would have been when I first entered
your service.”

“_Sicuro!_ She hassa seventeen years old now,” said Madame Oriano
sharply. “She hadda only eleven years then.”

“Sweet seventeen!” Caleb sighed.

“_Non credo che sia tanto dolce._”

“Oh, I do wish that I understood Italian a little better,” Caleb
groaned unctuously.

“I say I do notta tink she issa so very damn sweet. I tink she issa—how
you say in English—one beech.”

No doubt, Caleb profoundly agreed with this characterisation of
Letizia, held he up never so plump a protestant hand.

“Oh, do give your consent to our marriage,” he gurgled. “I know that
there is a difference of religion. But I have ventured to think once
or twice that you could overlook that difference. I have remarked
sometimes that you did not appear to attach very great importance to
your religion. I’ve even ventured to pray that you might come in time
to perceive the errors of Romanism. In fact, I have dreamed more than
once, ma’am, that you were washed in the blood of the Lamb. However,
do not imagine that I should try to influence Letizia to become one of
the Peculiar Children of God. I love her too dearly, ma’am, to attempt
any persuasion. From a business point of view—and, after all, in these
industrious times it is the business point of view which is really
important—from a business point of view the match would not be a very
bad one. I have a few humble savings, the fruit of my long association
with you in your enterprises.”

Caleb paused a moment and took a deep breath. He had reached the
critical point in his temptation of Madame Oriano, and he tried to
put into his tone the portentousness that his announcement seemed to
justify.

“Nor have I been idle in my spare time, ma’am. No, I have devoted much
of that spare time to study. I have been rewarded, ma’am. God has been
very good to me and blessed the humble talent with which he entrusted
me. Yes, ma’am. I have discovered a method of using chlorate of potash
in combination with various other chemicals which will undoubtedly
revolutionise the whole art of pyrotechny. Will you consider me
presumptuous, ma’am, when I tell you that I dream of the moment when
Fuller’s Fireworks shall become a byword all over Great Britain for all
that is best and brightest in the world of pyrotechny?”

Madame Oriano’s eyes flashed like Chinese fire, and Caleb, perceiving
that he had made a false move, tried to retrieve his position.

“Pray do not suppose that I was planning to set myself up as a
manufacturer of fireworks on my own. So long as you will have me,
ma’am, I shall continue to work for you, and if you consent to my
marrying your Letizia I shall put my new discovery at your service on a
business arrangement that will satisfy both parties.”

Madame Oriano pondered the proposal in silence for a minute.

“Yes, you can have Letizia,” she said at last.

Caleb picked up the hand that was hanging listlessly over the coverlet
and in the effusion of his gratitude saluted it with an oily kiss.

“And you’ll do your best to make Letizia accept me as a husband?” he
pressed.

“If I say you can have Letizia, _caro_, you willa have her,” the mother
declared.

“You have made me the happiest man in England,” Caleb oozed.

Whereupon he walked on tiptoe from the room with a sense even sharper
than usual that he was one of the Lord’s chosen vessels, a most
peculiar child even among the Peculiar Children of God.

Just when the hot August day had hung two dusky sapphire lamps in the
window of the room, Madame Oriano, who had been lying all the afternoon
staring up at the shadows of the birds that flitted across the ceiling,
rang the bell and demanded her daughter’s presence.

“_Letizia, devi sposarti_,” she said firmly.

“Get married, mamma? But I don’t want to be married for a long time.”

“_Non ci entra, cara. Devi sposarti. Sarebbe meglio—molto meglio. Sei
troppo sfrenata._”[7]

  [7] “That doesn’t come into it, my dear. You must get married. It
      would be better—much better. You are too harum-scarum.”

“I don’t see why it should be so much better. I’m not so harum-scarum
as all that. Besides, you never married at my age. You never married at
all if it comes to that.”

“_Lo so. Perciò dico che tu devi sposarti._”[8]

  [8] “I know that. That’s why I say that you must get married.”

“Thanks, and who am I to marry?”

“Caleb.”

“Caleb? Gemini! Caleb? Marry Caleb? But he’s so ugly! And he don’t wash
himself too often, what’s more.”

“_Bello non é ... ma che importa? La bellezza passa via._”

“Yes, I daresay beauty does pass away,” said Letizia indignantly. “But
it had passed away from Caleb before ever he was born.”

“_Che importa?_”

“I daresay it don’t matter to you. But you aren’t being expected to
marry him. Besides, you’ve had all the beaux you wanted. But I haven’t,
and I won’t be fobbed off with Caleb. I just won’t be, and you may do
what you will about it.”

“_Basta!_” Madame Oriano exclaimed. “Dissa talk is enough.”

“Basta yourself and be damned, mamma,” Letizia retorted. “I won’t
marry Caleb. I’d sooner be kept by a handsome gentleman in a big clean
cravat. I’d sooner live in a pretty house he’d give me and drive a
crimson curricle on the Brighton Road like Cora Delaney.”

“It does not import two pennies what you wish, _figlia mia_. You willa
marry Caleb.”

“But I’m not in love with him, the ugly clown!”

“Love!” scoffed her mother. “_L’amore! L’amore!_ Love is mad. I have
hadda so many lovers. _Tanti tanti amanti! Adesso, sono felice? No!
Ma sono vecchia assai._ Yes, an old woman—_una vecchia miserabile
senza amanti, senza gambe—e non si fa l’amore senza gambe, cara, ti
giuro—senza danaro, senza niente_.”

Sans love, sans legs, sans money, sans everything, the old woman
dropped back on her pillows utterly exhausted. A maid came in with
candles and pulled the curtains to shut out the dim grey into which the
August twilight had by now gradually faded. When the maid was gone, she
turned her glittering, sombre eyes upon her daughter.

“You willa marry Caleb,” she repeated. “It willa be better so—_molto
meglio cosi. Gli amanti non valgono niente._ All who I have been
loving, where are dey now? _Dove sono? Sono andati via._ Alla gone
away. Alla gone. You willa marry Caleb.”

Letizia burst into loud sobs.

“But I don’t want to marry, mamma.”

“_Meglio piangere a diciasette che rimpiangere a sessanta_,”[9] said
Madame Oriano solemnly. “You willa marry Caleb.”

  [9] “Better to weep at seventeen than to repine at sixty.”

Letizia felt incapable of resisting this ruthless old woman any longer.
She buried her head in the gaudy satin coverlet and wept in silence.

“_Allora dammi un bacio._”

The obedient daughter leaned over and kissed her mother’s lined
forehead.

“_Tu hai già troppo l’aria di putana, figlia mia. Meglio
sposarti. Lasciammi sola. Vorrei dormire. Sono stanca assai ...
assai._”[10]

  [10] “You have already too much the air of a wanton, my daughter.
       Better to get married. Leave me alone. I want to sleep. I’m
       very tired.”

Madame Oriano closed her eyes, and Letizia humbly and miserably left
her mother, as she wished to be left, alone.




                              CHAPTER IV

                             MARRIED LIFE


So, Caleb Fuller married Letizia Oriano and tamed her body, as without
doubt he would have succeeded in taming the body of any woman of whom
he had lawfully gained possession.

Madame Oriano did not long survive the marriage. The effort she made
in imposing her will upon her daughter was too much for a frame so
greatly weakened. Once she had had her way, the desire to live slowly
evaporated. Yet she was granted a last pleasure from this world before
she forsook it for ever. This was the satisfaction of beholding with
her own eyes that her son-in-law’s discovery of the value of chlorate
of potash as a colour intensifier was all that he claimed for it. That
it was likely to prove excessively dangerous when mixed with sulphur
compounds did not concern this pyrotechnist of the old school. The
prodigious depth and brilliant clarity of those new colours would be
well worth the sacrifice of a few lives through spontaneous ignition in
the course of manufacturing them.

The first public demonstration that Caleb gave was on the evening of
the Fifth of November in a Clerkenwell tea-garden. It is unlikely that
Madame Oriano ever fully comprehended the significance of these annual
celebrations. If she ever did wonder who Guy Fawkes was, she probably
supposed him to be some local English saint whose martyrdom deserved to
be commemorated by an abundance of rockets. As for Caleb, he justified
to himself some of the pleasure that his fireworks gave to so many
people by the fact that the chief festival at which they were employed
was held in detestation of a Papist conspirator.

On this particular Fifth of November the legless old lady was
carried in an invalid’s chair through the press of spectators to a
favourable spot from which she could judge the worth of the improved
fireworks. A few of the rabble jumped to the conclusion that she was a
representation of Guy Fawkes himself, and set up the ancient chorus:

    Please to remember the Fifth of November
    Gunpowder treason and plot;
    We know no reason why gunpowder treason
    Should ever be forgot!
    A stick and a stake for King George’s sake,
    A stick and a stump for Guy Fawkes’s rump
    Holla, boys! holla, boys! huzza-a-a!

Madame Oriano smiled grimly when Caleb tried to quiet the clamour by
explaining that she was flesh and blood.

“Letta dem sing, Caleb. _Non fa niente a me._ It don’ta matter notting
to me.”

A maroon burst to mark the opening of the performance. This was
followed by half-a-dozen rockets, the stars of which glowed with such
greens and blues and reds as Madame Oriano had never dreamed of. She
tried to raise herself in her chair.

“Bravo, Caleb! _Bravissimo! Ah dio, non posso più!_ It is the besta
_colore_ I havva ever seen, Caleb. _E ottimo! Ottimo, figlio mio._”

She sat entranced for the rest of the display; that night, like a spent
firework, the flame of her ardent life burnt itself out.

The death of his mother-in-law allowed Caleb to carry out a plan he
had been contemplating for some time. This was to open a factory in
Cheshire on the outskirts of his native town. He anticipated trouble
at first with the Peculiar Children of God, who were unlikely to view
with any favour the business of making fireworks. He hoped, however,
that the evidence of his growing prosperity would presently change
their point of view. There was no reason to accuse Caleb of hypocrisy,
or to suppose that he was anything but perfectly sincere in his desire
to occupy a high place in the esteem of his fellow believers. Marriage
with a Papist had in truth begun to worry his conscience more than a
little. So long as Letizia had been a temptation, the fact of her being
a daughter of Babylon instead of a Peculiar Child of God had only made
the temptation more redoubtable, and the satisfaction of overcoming
it more sharp. Now that he was licensed to enjoy her, he began to
wonder what effect marriage with a Papist would have on his celestial
patron. He felt like a promising young clerk who has imperilled his
prospects by marrying against his employer’s advice. It began to seem
essential to his salvation that he should take a prominent part in the
prayer-meetings of the Peculiar Children of God. He was ambitious to
be regarded himself as the most peculiar child of all those Peculiar
Children. Moreover, from a practical standpoint the opening of a
factory in the North should be extremely profitable. He already had the
London clients of Madame Oriano; he must now build up a solid business
in the provinces. Fuller’s Fireworks must become a byword. The King was
rumoured to be ill. He would be succeeded by another king. That king
would in due course have to be solemnly crowned. Liverpool, Manchester,
Sheffield, Leeds, and many other large towns would be wanting to
celebrate that coronation with displays of fireworks. When the moment
arrived, there must be nobody who would be able to compete with Fuller
and his chlorate of potash.

So to Brigham in Cheshire Caleb Fuller brought his wife. In some fields
on the outskirts of the town in which he had spent a poverty-stricken
youth he built his first sheds, and in a dreary little street close
to Bethesda, the meeting-house of the Peculiar Children of God, he
set up his patriarchal tent. Here on a dusty September dawn just over
two years after her last public appearance at “Neptune’s Grotto,”
Letizia’s eldest daughter was born. The young wife of Caleb was not
yet thoroughly tamed, for she produced a daughter exactly like herself
and called her Caterina in spite of the father’s objection to a name
associated with the wheels of which he made so many. Not only did she
insist on calling the child Caterina, but she actually took it to the
nearest Catholic chapel and had it baptised by a priest.

It happened about this time that one of the apostles of the
meeting-house was gravely ill, and Caleb, who had designs on the vacant
apostolic chair, decided that his election to it must not be endangered
by the profane behaviour of his young wife. When he remonstrated with
her, she flashed her eyes and tossed her head as if he were still Caleb
the clerk and she the spoilt daughter of his employer.

“Letizia,” he said lugubriously, “you have destroyed the soul of our
infant.”

“Nonsense!”

“You have produced a child of wrath.”

“My eye!” she scoffed.

Caleb’s moist lips vanished from sight. There was a long silence while
he regarded his wife with what seemed like two pebbles of granite. When
at last he spoke, it was with an intolerable softness.

“Letizia, you must learn to have responsibilities. I am frightened for
you, my wife. You must learn. I do not blame you entirely. You have had
a loose upbringing. But you must learn.”

Then, as gently as he was speaking, he stole to the door and left
Letizia locked behind him in her bedroom. Oh, yes, he tamed her body
gradually, and for a long time it looked as if he would tame her soul.
She had no more daughters like herself, and each year for many years
she flashed her eyes less fiercely and tossed her head less defiantly.
She produced several other children, but they all took after their
father. Dark-eyed Caterina was followed by stodgy Achsah. Stodgy
Achsah was followed by podgy Thyrza. These were followed by two more
who died almost as soon as they were born, as if in dying thus they
expressed the listlessness of their mother for this life. Maybe Letizia
herself would have achieved death, had not the way Caleb treated little
Caterina kept her alive to protect the child against his severity.

“Her rebellious spirit must be broken,” he declared, raising once more
the cane.

“You shall not beat her like this, Caleb.”

“Apostle Jenkins beat his son till the child was senseless, because he
stole a piece of bread and jam.”

“I wish I could be as religious as you, Caleb,” said his wife.

He tried to look modest under the compliment.

“Yes,” she went on fiercely, “for then I’d believe in Hell, and if I
believed in Hell I’d sizzle there with joy just for the pleasure of
seeing you and all your cursed apostles sizzling beside me.”

But Letizia did not often break out like this. Each year she became
more silent, taking refuge from her surroundings in French novels
which she bought out of the meagre allowance for clothes that her
husband allowed her. She read French novels because she despised the
more sentimental novelists of England that were so much in vogue at
this date, making only an exception in favour of Thackeray, whom she
read word for word as his books appeared. She was learning a bitter
wisdom from literature in the shadows and the silence of her wounded
heart. After eight years of married life she bore a son, who was called
Joshua. There were moments when Letizia was minded to smother him
where he lay beside her, so horribly did this homuncule reproduce the
lineaments of her loathed husband.

Meanwhile, the factory flourished, Caleb Fuller became the leading
citizen of Brigham and served three times as Mayor. He built a great
gloomy house on the small hill that skirted the mean little town.
He built, too, a great gloomy tabernacle for the Peculiar Children
of God. He was elected chief apostle and sat high up in view of the
congregation on a marble chair. He grew shaggy whiskers and suffered
from piles. He found favour in the eyes of the Lord, sweating the poor
and starving even the cows that gave him milk. Yes, the renown of
Fuller’s Fireworks was spread far and wide. The factory grew larger
year by year. And with it year by year waxed plumper the belly and the
purse of Caleb himself, even as his soul shrivelled.

In 1851 after twenty years of merciless prosperity Caleb suffered
his first setback by failing to secure the contract for the firework
displays at the Great Exhibition. From the marble chair of the chief
apostle he called upon the Peculiar Children of God to lament that
their Father had temporarily turned away His countenance from them.
Caleb beat his breast and bellowed and groaned, but he did not rend
his garments of the best broadcloth, because that would have involved
his buying new ones. The hulla-balloo in Bethesda was louder than
that in a synagogue on the Day of Atonement, and after a vociferous
prayer-meeting the Peculiar Children of God went back to their stuffy
and secretive little houses, coveting their neighbours’ wives and their
neighbours’ maids, but making the best of their own to express an
unattainable ideal. Horrid stuffy little bedrooms with blue jets of gas
burning dimly through the night-time. Heavy lumps of humanity snoring
beneath heavy counterpanes. Lascivious backbiting of the coveted wives
and maids on greasy conjugal pillows. Who in all that abode of prurient
respectability and savage industrialism should strip Caleb’s soul
bare? Who should not sympathise with the chief apostle of the Peculiar
Children of God?

Yet, strange to say, Caleb found that God’s countenance continued to
be averted from his own. He was still licking the soreness of his
disappointment over the Exhibition fireworks when one morning in the
prime of June his eldest daughter left the great gloomy house on the
hill, never to return. While Caleb stormed at his wife for not taking
better precautions to keep Caterina in bounds, he was aware that he
might as well be storming at a marble statue. He lacked the imagination
to understand that the soul of Letizia had fled from its imprisonment
in the guise of Caterina’s lissom body. But he did apprehend, however
dimly, that henceforth nothing he might say or do would ever again
affect his wife either for good or for ill.

Cold dark eyes beneath black arched brows surveyed him contemptuously.
He had never yet actually struck Letizia; but he came near to striking
her at that moment.

“She wanted to go on the stage.”

“A play-actress! My eldest daughter a play-actress!”

“Alas, neither she nor I can cup those drops of blood she owes to you.
But her soul is hers and mine. You had no part in making that. Even if
you did crawl over my body and eat the heart out of me, you slug! Do
what you like with the others. Make what you can of them. But Caterina
is mine. Caterina is free.”

“As if I had not suffered enough this year,” Caleb groaned.

“Suffered? Did you say that you had suffered?” His wife laughed. “And
what about the sufferings of my Caterina all these years of her youth?”

“I pray she’ll starve to death,” he went on.

“She was starving to death in this house.”

“Ay, I suppose that’s what the Church folk will be saying next. The
idle, good-for-nothing slanderers! Not content with accusing me of
starving my cows, they’ll be accusing me of starving my children now.
But the dear Lord knows....”

“You poor dull fool,” Letizia broke in, and with one more glance from
her cold dark eyes she left him.

Caterina had as dissolute a career as her father could have feared and
as miserable an end as he could have hoped, for about twelve years
later, after glittering with conspicuous shamelessness amid the tawdry
gilt of the Second Empire, she died in a Paris asylum prematurely
exhausted by drink and dissipation.

“Better to die from without than from within,” said her mother when the
news was brought to Brigham.

“What do you mean by that?” Caleb asked in exasperated perplexity.
“It’s all these French novels you read that makes you talk that
high-flown trash. You talk for the sake of talking, that’s my opinion.
You used to talk like a fool when I first married you, but I taught you
at last to keep your tongue still. Now you’ve begun to talk again.”

“One changes in thirty-four years, Caleb. Even you have changed. You
were mean and ugly then. But you are much meaner and much uglier now.
However, you have the consolation of seeing your son Joshua keep pace
with you in meanness and in ugliness.”

Joshua Fuller was now twenty-six, an eternal offence to the eyes of his
mother, who perceived in him nothing but a dreadful reminder of her
husband at the same age. That anybody could dare to deplore Caterina’s
life when in Joshua the evidence of her own was before them enraged
Letizia with human crassness. But Joshua was going to be an asset to
Fuller’s Fireworks. Just as his father had perceived the importance
of chlorate of potash in 1829, so now in 1863 did Joshua perceive
the importance of magnesium, and the house of Fuller was in front
of nearly all its rivals in utilising that mineral, with the result
that its brilliant fireworks sold better than ever. The Guilloché and
Salamandre, the Girandole and Spirali of Madame Oriano, so greatly
admired by old moons and bygone multitudes, would have seemed very
dull affairs now. Another gain that Joshua provided for the business
was to urge upon his father to provide for the further legislation
about explosives that sooner or later was inevitable. With an ill
grace Caleb Fuller had complied with the provisions of the Gunpowder
Act of 1860; but, when the great explosion at Erith occurred a few
years later, Joshua insisted that more must be done to prepare for the
inspection of firework establishments that was bound to follow such a
terrific disaster. Joshua was right, and when the Explosives Act of
1875 was passed the factory at Brigham had anticipated nearly all its
requirements.

By this time Joshua was a widower. In 1865, at the age of twenty-eight,
he had married a pleasant young woman called Susan Yardley. After
presenting him with one boy who was christened Abraham, she died two
years later in producing another who was christened Caleb after his
grandfather.

The elder of these two boys reverted both in appearance and in
disposition to the Oriano stock, and old Mrs. Fuller—she is sixty-three
now and may no longer be called Letizia—took a bitter delight in never
allowing old Mr. Fuller to forget it. She found in the boy, now a flash
of Caterina’s eyes, now a flutter of Madame Oriano’s eyelids. She
would note how much his laugh was like her own long ago, and she would
encourage him at every opportunity to thwart the solicitude and defy
the injunctions of Aunt Achsah and Aunt Thyrza. When her son protested
against the way she applauded Abraham’s naughtiness, she only laughed.

“Bram’s all right.”

“I wish, mamma, you wouldn’t call him Bram,” Joshua protested. “It’s
so irreverent. I know that you despise the Bible, but the rest of
us almost worship it. I cannot abide this irreligious clipping of
Scriptural names. And it worries poor papa terribly.”

“It won’t worry your father half as much to hear Bram called Bram as
it’ll worry poor little Bram later on to be called Abraham. That boy’s
all right, Josh. He’s the best firework you’ve turned out of this
factory for many a day. So, don’t let Achsah and Thyrza spoil him.”

“They try their best to be strict, mamma.”

“I’m talking about their physic, idiot. They’re a pair of pasty-faced
old maids, and it’s unnatural and unpleasant to let them be for ever
messing about with a capital boy like Bram. Let them physic young
Caleb. He’ll be no loss to the world. Bram might be.”

Joshua threw his eyes up to Heaven and left his unaccountable mother
to her own unaccountable thoughts. He often wondered why his father
had never had her shut up in an asylum. For some time now she had been
collecting outrageous odds and ends of furniture for her room to which
none of the family was allowed access except by special invitation.
Ever since Caterina had run away old Mrs. Fuller had had a room of
her own. But she had been content with an ordinary bed at first. Now
she had procured a monstrous foreign affair all gilt and Cupids and
convolutions. If Joshua had been his father he would have taken steps
to prevent such a waste of her allowance. He fancied that the old man
must be breaking up to allow such furniture to enter the house.

Not long after the conversation between Joshua and his mother about
Bram, a travelling circus arrived at Brigham on a Sunday morning.
The Peculiar Children of God shivered at such a profanation of the
Sabbath, and Apostle Fuller—in these days a truly patriarchal figure
with his long white food-bespattered beard—preached from the marble
chair on the vileness of these sacrilegious mountebanks and the
pestilent influence any circus must have on a Christian town. In spite
of this denunciation the chief apostle’s own wife dared to take her
elder grandchild on Monday to view from the best seats obtainable the
monstrous performance. They sat so near the ring that the sawdust and
the tan were scattered over them by the horses’ hoofs. Little Bram, his
chin buried in the worn crimson velvet of the circular barrier, gloated
in an ecstasy on the paradisiacal vision.

“_Brava! Bravissima!_” old Mrs. Fuller cried loudly when a demoiselle
of the _haute école_ took an extra high fence. “_Brava! Bravissima!_”
she cried when an equestrienne in pink tights leapt through four
blazing hoops and regained without disarranging one peroxide curl the
shimmering back of her piebald steed.

“Oh, grandmamma,” little Bram gasped when he bade her good night, “can
I be a clown when I’m a man?”

“The difficulty is not to be a clown when one is a man,” she answered
grimly.

“What _do_ you mean, grandmamma?”

“Ah, what?” she sighed.

And in their stuffy and secretive little bedrooms that night the
Peculiar Children of God talked for hours about the disgraceful amount
of leg that those circus women had shown.

“I hear it was extremely suggestive,” said one apostle, smacking his
lips with lecherous disapprobation.

“Was it, indeed, my dear?” the dutiful wife replied, thereby offering
the man of God an opportunity to enlarge upon the prurient topic before
he turned down the gas and got into bed beside her.

“Bram was very naughty to go to the circus, wasn’t he, Aunt Achsah?”
young Caleb asked in a tone of gentle sorrow when his pasty-faced aunt
leaned over that Monday night to lay her wet lips to his plump pink
cheeks.

“Grandpapa was very cross,” Aunt Achsah mournfully replied, evading the
direct answer, but implying much by her expression.

“Gran’papa’s not cross with me, is he, auntie?” young Caleb asked with
an assumption of fervid anxiety.

“No, my dear child, and I hope that you will never, never make your
dear grandfather cross with you.”

“Oh, I won’t, Aunt Achsah,” young Caleb promised, with what Aunt Achsah
told Aunt Thyrza was really and truly the smile of one of God’s most
precious lambs.

“Thyrza, Thyrza, when that blessed little child smiles like that,
nobody could deny him anything. I’m sure his path down this vale of
tears will always be smoothed by that angelic smile.”

She was talking to her sister in the passage just outside young Caleb’s
bedroom—he had already been separated from his elder brother for fear
of corruption—and he heard what she said.

When the footsteps of his aunts died away along the passage, the fat
little boy got out of bed, turned up the gas, and smiled at himself
several times in the looking-glass. Then he retired to bed again,
satisfied of his ability to summon that conquering smile to his aid
whenever he should require it.




                               CHAPTER V

                          TINTACKS IN BRIGHAM


On a wet and gusty afternoon in the month of March, 1882, Bram Fuller,
now a stripling of sixteen, sat in one of the dingiest rooms of that
great gloomy house his grandfather had begun to build forty years
before. It looked less stark, now that the evergreen trees had grown
large enough to hide some of its grey rectangularity; but it did not
look any more cheerful in consequence. In some ways it had seemed less
ugly at first, when it stood on top of the mean little hill and was
swept clean by the Cheshire winds. Now its stucco was stained with
great green fronds and arabesques of damp caused by the drip of the
trees and the too close shrubberies of lanky privet and laurel that
sheltered its base. Old Mr. Fuller and his son were both under the
mistaken impression that the trees planted round Lebanon House—thus
had the house been named—were cedars. Whereas there was not even so
much as a deodar among the crowd of starveling pines and swollen
cryptomerias. Noah’s original ark perched on the summit of Ararat amid
the surrounding waters probably looked a holier abode than Lebanon
House above the sea of Brigham roofs.

The town had grown considerably during half a century, and old Mr.
Fuller had long ago leased the derelict pastures, in which his cows
had tried to eke out a wretched sustenance on chickweed and sour dock,
to accommodate the enterprising builder of rows of little two-storied
houses, the colour of underdone steak. The slopes of the hill on
which the house stood had once been covered with fruit-trees, but the
poisoning of the air by the various chemical factories, which had
increased in number every year, had long made them barren. Joshua had
strongly advised his father to present the useless slopes to Brigham as
a public recreation ground. It was to have been a good advertisement
both for the fireworks and for the civic spirit that was being fostered
by the Peculiar Children of God. As a matter of fact, Joshua himself
had some time ago made up his mind to join the Church of England as
soon as his father died. He was beginning to think that the Bethesda
Tabernacle was not sufficiently up-to-date as a spiritual centre for
Fuller’s Fireworks, and he was more concerned for the civic impression
than the religious importance of the gift. On this March afternoon,
however, the slopes of Lebanon were still a private domain, for old Mr.
Fuller could never bring himself to give away nine or ten acres of land
for nothing. He was much too old to represent Brigham in Parliament
himself, and it never struck him that Joshua might like to do so.

So, Bram Fuller was able to gaze out of the schoolroom window, to
where, beyond the drenched evergreens hustling one another in the
wind, the drive ran down into Brigham between moribund or skeleton
apple-trees fenced in on either side by those raspberry-tipped
iron railings that his grandfather had bought so cheaply when the
chock-a-block parish churchyard was abolished and an invitingly empty
cemetery was set apart on the other side of the town for the coming
generations of Brigham dead. Bram was still a day-boy at the grammar
school, and as this afternoon was the first half-holiday of the month
he was being allowed to have a friend to tea. Jack Fleming was late,
though. There was no sign of him yet coming up the slope through the
wind and wet. Bram hoped that nothing had happened to keep him at home.
He was so seldom allowed to entertain friends that Jack’s failure
to appear would have been an overwhelming disappointment. He looked
round the schoolroom dejectedly. Never had it seemed so dingy and
comfortless. Never had that outline portrait of Queen Victoria, filled
in not with the substance of her regal form, but with an account
of her life printed in minute type, seemed such a futile piece of
ingenuity; never had the oilcloth seemed infested with so many crumbs,
nor the table-cloth such a kaleidoscope of jammy stains.

Old Mrs. Fuller had been right when she recognised in the baby Bram her
own race. She and he had their way, and Abraham was never heard now
except in the mouth of the grandfather. Yes, he was almost a perfect
Oriano, having inherited nothing from his father, and from his mother
only her pleasant voice. He was slim, with a clear-cut profile and fine
dark hair; had one observed him idling gracefully on a sun-splashed
_piazza_, he would have appeared more appropriate to the setting
than to any setting that Brigham could provide. He was a popular and
attractive youth with a talent for mimicry, and a gay and fluent wit.
His young brother, who fortunately for the enjoyment of Bram and his
friend had been invited forth himself this afternoon, was a perfect
Fuller save that he had inherited from his mother a fresh complexion
which at present only accentuated his plumpness. All the Fuller
characteristics were there—the greedy grey eyes, the podgy white hands,
the fat rump and spindle legs, the full wet lips and slimy manner.
To all this young Caleb could add his own smile of innocent candour
when it suited his purpose to produce it. At school he was notorious
as a toady and a sneak, but he earned a tribute of respect from the
sons of a commercial community by his capacity for swopping to his own
advantage and by his never failing stock of small change, which he was
always willing to lend at exorbitant interest on good security. Bram
was badly in debt to his young brother at the present moment, and this
added something to the depression of the black March afternoon, though
that was lightened at last by the tardy arrival of his expected friend
with the news that Blundell’s Diorama had arrived in Brigham and would
exhibit itself at seven o’clock.

“We must jolly well go, Bramble,” Jack declared.

Bram shook his head despondently.

“No chink!”

“Can’t you borrow some from young Caleb?”

“I owe him two and threepence halfpenny already, and he’s got my best
whalebone-splice bat as a security till I pay him back.”

“Good Lord, and I’ve only got sixpence,” Jack Fleming groaned.

“Anyway, it’s no use,” Bram went on. “The governor wouldn’t let me go
into Brigham on a Saturday night.”

“Can’t you find some excuse?”

Bram pondered for a few seconds.

“I might get my grandmater to help.”

“Well, buck up, Bramble. It’s a spiffing show, I hear. They’ve got two
girls with Italian names who play the guitar or something. We don’t
often get a chance of a decent evening in Brigham.”

“You’re right, Jack. All serene! Then I’ll have a try with the
grandmater. She’s such an old fizzer that she might manage it.”

Bram went up cautiously to old Mrs. Fuller’s room. She was seventy now,
but still able to hate fiercely her octogenarian husband who was for
ever browsing among dusty commentaries on the Old Testament nowadays,
and extracting from the tortuous fretwork of bookworms such indications
of the Divine purpose as the exact date and hour of the Day of
Judgment. He was usually clad in a moth-eaten velveteen dressing-gown
and a smoking cap of quilted black silk with a draggled crimson tassel.
The latter must have been worn as a protection to his bald and scaly
head, because not a puff of tobacco smoke had ever been allowed to
contend with the odour of stale food that permeated Lebanon House from
cellar to garret.

The old lady was sitting by the fire in her rococo parlour, reading
Alphonse Daudet’s new book. Her hawk’s face seemed to be not so much
wrinkled as finely cracked like old ivory. Over her shoulders she wore
a wrap of rose and silver brocade.

“Why, Bram, I thought you were entertaining visitors this afternoon.”

“I am. He’s downstairs in the schoolroom. Jack Fleming, I mean.”

“Is that a son of that foxy-faced solicitor in High Street?”

Bram nodded.

“But Jack’s rather decent. I think you’d like him, grandmamma.”

“Ah, I’m too old to begin liking new people.”

Bram kicked his legs together, trying to make up his mind what line to
adopt for enlisting the old lady’s sympathy.

“Blundell’s Diorama is here,” he announced at last.

“What’s that? A new disease?”

The boy laughed.

“It does sound rather like a disease, doesn’t it? No, it’s the same
sort of thing as Poole’s Myriorama.”

“I’m no wiser.”

“Well, it’s a set of large coloured pictures of places in foreign
parts. And there are some singers with guitars. Italian perhaps.” Ah,
cunning Bram!

“Italian, eh? And you want to gaze into their liquid and passionate
orbs, eh?”

“I would rather like to—only as a matter of fact I haven’t got any
chink. Caleb lent me some, but he won’t lend me any more till I pay him
back. I’ve had to give him my best bat till I do.”

“How much do you owe the little alligator?”

“Two and threepence halfpenny, and sixpence interest up to date, and
twopence for the linseed oil for oiling the bat, because he said
he’d have to keep it in good condition during the winter. Two and
elevenpence halfpenny altogether.”

Mrs. Fuller grunted.

“And anyway papa won’t let me go down into Brigham unless I can get a
good excuse.”

“And so you want an excuse from me? _Ho capito._ Well, Bram, it’s a
strange thing, but my rheumatism has suddenly become very bad and I’d
be much obliged if you’d go down into Brigham and buy me a bottle
of embrocation. Here’s five shillings. I don’t want the change. St.
Jumbo’s Oil is the name of the embrocation. It’ll probably take you all
the evening to find it, and if you don’t find it I shan’t really mind,
because my rheumatism is bound to be much better by the time you come
back.”

“I say, grandmamma, you are ... you are....”

But Bram could not find any word to describe her suitably without
blushing too deeply to attempt it.

Blundell’s Diorama which filled the Brigham Corn Exchange (not much
corn was sold there by this date) was an entertainment at which the
least sophisticated would scoff in these cinematographic days. It
consisted of a series of crude and highly coloured views of the world’s
beauty spots treated in the panoramic manner of the drop-curtain. The
lighting was achieved by gas footlights and floats with occasional
assistance from amber, green, and crimson limes. Mr. Blundell himself,
a gentleman with a moustache like an Aintree hurdle, and dressed in a
costume that was something between a toreador’s, a cowboy’s, and an
operatic brigand’s, stood in front to point out with a stock-rider’s
whip the chief objects of interest in each picture that was unrolled
for an absorbed audience.

“This scene to which I now have the pleasure of inviting your earnest
attention represents the world-famous Bay of Naples. ‘Veedy Napowly
ee poy morry,’ as Dante said. Dante, I may remind you was the Italian
equivalent of our own William Shakespeare, the world-famous dramatic
genius at whose house in Stratford-on-Avon we have already taken a
little peep this evening. Yes, ‘See Naples and die,’ said the Italian
poet. In other words, ‘Don’t waste your time over sprats when there’s
whales to be caught.’ The world-famous fir-tree, on the extreme right
of the picture as I stand, is reputed to be two thousand years old,
and under its hoary branches it is said that the Emperor Nero held
many of his most degraded orgies, which I shall not sully your eyes by
exhibiting at an entertainment to which I flatter myself the youngest
infant in Brigham can come without a blush. The waters of the Bay of
Naples as you will note are always blue, and the inhabitants of the gay
city are renowned for macaroni and musical abilities. With your kind
permission the Sisters Garibaldi will now give you a slight impression
of the atmosphere of Beller Napowly as it is affectionately called.”

Two young women dressed in ribbons and sequins immediately pranced on
to sing _Santa Lucia_, while the lecturer beat time with his stockwhip,
rolling occasionally a sentimental eye at the audience. When the music
was over, he invited their attention to various architectural features
in the landscape, and then, assuming a tragic profundity of tone, he
continued:

“Hitherto all has been fair, but the words ‘See Naples and die’ have
sometimes been fraught with a much deeper significance. On the extreme
left as I stand you will observe towering above the unconscious city
the mighty peak of Vesuvius, the world-famous volcano which from time
to time commits the most horrible eruptions and threatens to overwhelm
with boiling lava the gay city at its base. With your kind permission I
shall now have the pleasure of giving you a realistic representation of
the city of pleasure when threatened by one of the burning mountain’s
all too frequent outbursts.”

He signalled with his whip to the limelight man at the back of the
hall. Whereupon after a loud preliminary fizzing a crimson glow
suffused the whole picture, while the orchestra, consisting of a piano,
a flageolet, and a double-bass, played the “Dead March” from _Saul_.

“Our next picture shows you the world-famous Alhambra of Granada by
moonlight....”

No tragedy here, but a transparency moon and a _pas de deux_ by the
Sisters Garibaldi accompanied by castanets, which on the authority
of Mr. Blundell was a lifelike rendering of the world-famous Spanish
fandango....

When the performance was over, Bram emerged from his circumgyration
of the illustrated world feeling that something must be done about
Brigham. After the sequins and ribbons and cobalt seas, after
bullfights and earthquakes, juggernauts, pagodas, and palms, Brigham
in the wind and wet of a Saturday night in March was not to be
endured without some kind of protest. To go meekly back to Lebanon
House and a long jobation from his father on the sin of attending
a public performance in which female dancers actively participated
was unimaginable in this elated mood. If there had to be a row, why
couldn’t there be a row over something that really deserved it?

“My gosh, Jack, I’m just itching to do something,” he confided to his
chum. “Don’t you wish we had wings and could fly right away to the
other end of the world now?”

“What’s the use of wishing for wings?” objected young Fleming, who
had enjoyed the entertainment, but was not prepared to be mentally
extravagant in its honour.

“Well, of course I don’t mean real wings,” Bram explained. “Only, I
simply can’t stick Brigham much longer. I couldn’t stick it even if I
left school.”

They were passing Bethesda as Bram was speaking, and the sight of its
hideousness looming up in the empty wet gaslit street revolted the boy.

“I wish I could burn that down,” he exclaimed savagely.

“Well, you can’t do that either,” said his friend. “So what’s the good
of wishing?”

“I say, Jack, there’s a window open! I believe I could climb in,”
declared Bram in sudden excitement.

Jack Fleming was not one of the Peculiar Children of God, nor had he
any clear notion how severe a penalty was entailed by sacrilege; but
the idea of climbing into any place of worship by night—church, chapel,
or meeting-house—filled him with superstitious dread, besides alarming
him in its legal aspect.

“Don’t be a mad ass,” he adjured his friend. “What would you do if you
did climb in?”

“Oh, I don’t know. Just mess it up,” said Bram.

“But supposing you were caught?”

“Well, it would be worth a row. You don’t know my governor, Jack. If
you knew him, you’d do anything that was worth while getting pi-jaws
for. I get pi-jaws now for nothing. If you funk it, don’t stay with me.
But I’m going to climb into that rotten old tabernacle, and if I can
burn it up, I jolly well will burn it up.”

Jack Fleming was seized with panic. Bram was always a mad sort of chap,
but this project was far madder than anything of which he had fancied
him capable.

“Look here, I’ve got to be in soon,” he protested. “And you’ve farther
to go than I have. Don’t play the giddy goat.”

But Bram’s mind was dancing with the brightness of Blundell’s Diorama.
He had no patience with the dull brain of his friend.

“I tell you I’m going to climb in,” he insisted.

“Well, I tell you I’m going home,” said Jack.

“All right then, go!” Bram could not forbear shooting a poisoned shaft.
“Only if there’s a row, don’t peach, that’s all I ask.”

“You needn’t sneer at a fellow just because he doesn’t happen to be
quite such a giddy goat as yourself,” said Jack.

But Bram was riding over the deserts of Arabia: he was away on the
prairies farther than Fenimore Cooper or Mayne Reid had ever taken him;
Chimborazo towered above his horizon, not the chimney-pots of Brigham.

“See you on Monday as usual,” he called back cheerfully to his friend
as he leapt up and caught hold of the sill. A moment later his lithe
shape had vanished in the darkness of Bethesda. Jack Fleming hesitated
a moment: but after all he was not one of the Peculiar Children of God,
and if it became a case for the magistrates, they might take a more
serious view of his behaviour as the son of a church-going solicitor
than of Bram’s, who was the grandson of a chief apostle. Jack turned
his face homeward.

Meanwhile, inside the tabernacle Bram was wondering what he should
do with the beastly place. He struck a match, but the shadows it
conjured all over the great gaunt building made him nervous, and he
soon abandoned the project of burning the whole place to the ground. He
thought and thought how to celebrate his adventure at the expense of
the worshippers when they gathered together to-morrow morning to groan
loudly over their own sins and louder still over the sins of other
people. He could think of nothing. Inspiration was utterly lacking.
Had he known beforehand that he was going to break into Bethesda like
this, what a multitude of tricks he would have been ready to play. As
it was, he would just have to climb out again and be content with the
barren triumph of having climbed in. He had struck another match to
light his path out among the benches without barking his shins as he
had barked them feeling his way in from the window, and it illuminated
a cardboard packet of tintacks evidently left there by the caretaker,
who must have been renovating something or other in honour of the
approaching Sabbath. Bram did not hesitate, but forthwith arranged four
tintacks on each of the pitch-pine chairs of the eleven apostles and
actually half-a-dozen, and these carefully chosen for their length and
sharpness, on the marble chair of the chief apostle himself. For once
in a way he should look forward to Sunday morning; for the first time
in his life he should be able to encounter with relish the smell of
veils and varnish in Bethesda. Of course, it would be too much to hope
that all the fifty tintacks would strike home, but the chances were
good for a generous proportion of successes, because it was the custom
of the twelve apostles to march in from the apostolic snuggery and
simultaneously take their seats with the precision of the parade-ground.

While Bram was having to stand up and listen to a long pi-jaw that
night on his return, he nearly laughed aloud in thinking that to-morrow
morning in Bethesda his father who occupied at present the chair of
James the Less would wish that he was standing too. Before going to bed
Bram went to wish good night to his grandmother and thank her for the
way she had helped him.

“I wish I could travel round the world, grandmamma.”

“Ah, child, be glad that you can still have wishes. It’s when all your
wishes turn to regrets that you can begin sobbing. Here am I, with only
one wish left.”

“What’s that?”

“The grave,” said the old lady.

Bram was startled when his grandmother said this with such simple
earnestness. Death presented itself to his young mind as something so
fantastically remote that thus to speak of it as within the scope of a
practical wish seemed to demand some kind of distraction to cure such
excitability.

“You never go to Bethesda, do you, grandmamma?”

She laughed and shook her head.

“I wish you’d come to-morrow morning.”

“What, at seventy become a Peculiar Child of God? No, Bram, I may be
in my second childhood, but it’s not going to be a peculiar second
childhood.”

“All the same, I wish you would come. I think you’ll laugh.”

Bram’s dark eyes were twinkling so brightly in anticipation of the
scene to-morrow morning that his grandmother’s curiosity was roused.
However, he would not tell her why he advised her to sample the
meeting-house for the first time in her life to-morrow. He still
retained enough of the child’s suspicion of the grown-up’s theory of
what is and what is not a good joke to make him cautious even with her,
though he was extremely anxious to give the old lady the benefit of the
diversion he had prepared. He was so urgent indeed that in the end she
actually promised to come if she felt able to stand the prospect in the
morning.

Before going to bed Bram went into his brother’s room and paid him back
the loan with interest.

“And I’ll have my bat to-night, thank you very much,” he said.

Caleb did not play cricket himself, but he was much disgusted at losing
the bat, because he had planned to sell it for at least five shillings
at the beginning of the summer term.

“Look here, I’ll give you three shillings for it, if you don’t want to
pay me back the money, Bram.”

“No, thanks.”

Caleb tried his last resource. Sleep was heavy on his eyelids, yet
he managed to suffuse his pink podgy countenance with that bland,
persuasive smile.

“It isn’t really worth more than two shillings, Bram, but as you’re my
brother I don’t mind giving you three for it.”

Bram had one tintack left in his pocket. This he dug into Caleb’s fat
leg.

“Ouch! You cad,” Caleb squealed. “You cad! You cad! What is it?”

“A tintack,” said Bram coolly. “Want it in again? No? All serene. Then
hand over the bat.”

He retired with his rescued treasure to his own room, and for five
minutes in the joy of repossession he practised playing forward and
back to the most devilishly tricky bowling until at last he caught the
leg of the bedstead a whack which clanged through the nocturnal quiet
of Lebanon House like an alarm bell. Whereupon Bram hurriedly put out
the gas and jumped into bed. People were right when they said he was
very young for his age and wondered how Joshua Fuller ever produced
such a flipperty-gibbet of a son.

The next morning was fine, and old Mrs. Fuller’s announcement that she
was going to visit Bethesda threw the household into consternation.

“Mamma!” the eldest daughter gasped. “Why, you’ve never....”

Mrs. Fuller quelled poor Achsah instantly.

“Thank you, my dear, I am not yet in my dotage. I know precisely what I
have done and what I have not done in my life.”

“You don’t think you’ll catch cold?” suggested Thyrza.

“Not if your father preaches about Hell,” said the old lady.

“If you’re coming to mock, mamma,” her son interposed, “I can’t help
feeling it would be better if you stopped away.”

“Hoity-toity, Master Joshua,” the old lady chuckled.

What the chief apostle thought about his wife’s intention did not
transpire, for he was so deaf nowadays that his family considered it
wiser not to apprise him of the sensational news. He would probably
never understand what they were trying to tell him, but if he should,
the nervous shock might easily render him as mute as he was deaf, to
the detriment of his weekly discourse, which was the delight of the
older Peculiars, flavoured as it was with the brimstone and sulphur of
the sect’s early days. The chief apostle, no doubt partly on account of
his pyrotechnical knowledge, could conjure hellish visions against any
preacher in the land.

There was some discussion about who should drive to chapel in the
Fuller brougham, a dreadful old conveyance looking like a large
bootblack’s box, which had been picked up cheap at the sale of a
deceased widow’s effects. Either Achsah or Thyrza usually accompanied
their father. There was no room for a third person when Mr. Fuller and
his beard were inside.

“Don’t disturb yourselves,” said Mrs. Fuller. “I’ve sent the boy to
fetch a fly from the hotel. Bram can be my beau.”

When she and her grandson were driving off together, she turned to him
and said:

“Now what is the reason for having dragged me out in this musty fly on
a Sunday morning?”

Her regard was so humorous and candid that the boy surrendered his
suspicion and confided to her what he had prepared for the apostles.

“I’ll give you sixpence for every tintack that goes hard home,” the old
lady vowed. “I’d give you a sovereign apiece, if I had the money.”

The congregation of Bethesda seemed to be composed of candle-faced
men and fiery-nosed women. The atmosphere literally did stink of
respectability, for even scented soap was considered a diabolic weapon.
However, in spite of the discouragement that the male Peculiars
accorded to the vanity of female dress, the female Peculiars were as
well equipped with panniers and bustles as the fashionable females of
other sects. In view of what was waiting for them, it was unfortunate
for the men that they too did not wear bustles. Bram cast an eye on the
apostles’ chairs and whispered to his grandmother that the tintacks
were undisturbed. She emitted a low chuckle of approbation such as that
with which a parrot welcomes some special effort of ventriloquism by a
human being.

The door of the apostolic snuggery opened. Shambling along with an
exaggeration of the way he used to shamble as a young man, followed
by a trail of dismal men, most of whom had mutton-chop whiskers,
came Caleb Fuller making for the chair of Simon Peter—oblivious
presumably of the Popish claims thereby implied. The sons of Zebedee
were represented by two grocers in partnership—Messrs. Giddy and
Dopping. Andrew suitably had an expatriated Scotsman in the person of
Maclozen the chemist. Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, and Thomas were
earthily represented by Mr. Hunnybum, Mr. Rabjohn, Mr. Campkin, and
Mr. Balmey. The seat of James the Less was Joshua Fuller’s. Simon and
Jude found their types of apostolic virtue in Mr. Pavitt and Mr. Pead,
and finally Mr. Fricker, a sandy-haired young man who walked the shop
of Mr. Rabjohn the draper, followed humbly in the rear as the coopted
Matthias, hoping no doubt one day to lead the lot as patriarchally as
Mr. Fuller was leading them this morning.

“Brethren,” the chief apostle groaned. “I am four score years and two
in the sight of the Lord, and my sins are as scarlet.”

“Made with chlorate of potash,” muttered Mrs. Fuller, “so bright a
scarlet are they.”

“Brethren, groan with me.”

The Peculiar Children of God groaned lustily.

“Brethren, we will now be seated until one of us shall be moved by the
Spirit of the Lord to testify.”

The congregation rustled down into their seats. The apostles sat down
firmly and austerely as became leaders of religion. The congregation
remained seated. The apostles rose with a unanimous howl, moved not by
the Spirit, but by the fifty tintacks, every one of which, by old Mrs.
Fuller’s reckoning when she paid over twenty-five shillings to Bram,
must have struck hard home.

Of course, there was an investigation into the lamentable affair by
the apostolic body of the Peculiar Children of God. The caretaker
was invited to explain the presence of all these tintacks on the
apostolic chairs. It was idle for the caretaker to deny all knowledge
of tintacks, because in the chapel accounts there was an item against
her, proving that she had only this week purchased for use in Bethesda
a large packet of tintacks. This purchase of tintacks she made no
attempt to deny, but she maintained, without her evidence being in the
least shaken, that when she last saw the tintacks the bulk of them
remained in the cardboard box from which she had taken only two or
three to nail down the strips of carpet on the benches where they had
come loose. It seemed equally idle for the apostles to accuse such
a ramshackle old woman of having deliberately arranged the tintacks
as weapons of offence, nor could it seriously be argued that mere
carelessness was responsible for leaving them about point upward in
groups of four. Some of the older apostles were inclined to blame the
Devil for the assault; but the younger members of the apostolic body,
reacting to the spirit of intellectual progress that was abroad, could
not accept the theory of so literally diabolic a practical joke. Mr.
Fricker, the junior apostle, put forward an opinion that the outrage
had been committed by members of the Salvation Army, a body which was
making considerable and most unwelcome progress in Brigham. The result
of the investigation, however, was to leave the horrid business wrapt
in mystery, in which costume it would doubtless have remained for ever
if that afternoon young Caleb Fuller had not said to his father with a
smile of radiant innocence:

“Papa, how funny it should have been tintacks on your chair.”

“What do you mean by ‘funny,’ my boy?” demanded Joshua angrily. “What
are you grinning at?”

“I didn’t mean to grin, papa,” said Caleb, turning out his smile as
swiftly as if it were a flaring gas-jet. “What I meant was ‘funny’ was
that last night Bram had a tintack in his pocket, because he ran it
into my leg.”

“Bram had a tintack?” repeated the father.

“Yes, and he was out late last night, and Mrs. Pead was saying outside
Bethesda that she’d noticed one of the windows in the chapel was left
open all last night.”

Joshua Fuller’s pasty face pulsed and sweated like a boiling beefsteak
pudding.

“Where’s Bram now?”

“He’s upstairs in grandmamma’s room, and they were laughing, papa.
I thought it funny they should be laughing like that on a Sunday
afternoon.”

“You thought it funny, did you?” Joshua growled. “If you don’t look out
for yourself, my boy, I’ll thrash you soundly when I’ve finished with
your brother.”

“What have _I_ done, papa?” Caleb began to blubber. “I thought you
wanted to find out who put the tintacks on the apostles’ chairs.”

But his father did not stop to listen. His only idea was to
punish Bram. The threat to Caleb was really nothing more than
the effervescence of his rage. In the hall he picked out from the
umbrella-stand a blackthorn stick, armed with which he entered his
mother’s parlour, where he found her feeding Bram with crumpets.

“So it was you, was it?” he chattered. “Go up to your bedroom and wait
for me.”

“What are you going to do to the boy?” old Mrs. Fuller demanded.

“What am I going to do to him? I’m going to teach him a lesson with
this.” He banged the floor with the blackthorn.

“You’ll never use that on him, Joshua,” said his mother.

“Won’t I?”

“Never! Bram, don’t let your father touch you with that stick. If he
strikes you, strike him. You’re as good a man as he is in a fight.
Strike him hard, hard, d’ye hear?”

“Are you mad, mamma, to encourage the young ruffian in this way?”

“He’ll be mad if he lets you strike him.”

While the other two were talking, a very white Bram was settling his
future as rapidly as a drowning man is supposed to review his past.
Fifty tintacks at sixpence apiece? Twenty-five shillings in his pocket.
The only time he had ever been rich in the whole of his life! This
would mean leaving the grammar school. He would have to work in the
factory. “The bottom of the ladder, my boy; that’s the way to begin.”
No pocket money. Sticking at accounts, Brigham, eternally, hopelessly.
Always Brigham. And Lebanon House. And the flogging. The pain wouldn’t
matter. But the disgrace of it at his age! And begging grandpapa’s
pardon. Shouting his apologies in those hairy ears. Coming always a
little closer and trying to make himself understood, closer still. So
close that he would be sick with the smell of stale food on that filthy
old white beard. Apologising to the rest of them. To Giddy and Dopping
and Hunnybum and Pead. Apologising to that horrible brute Fricker? No!
Prayed for publicly by the Peculiars as last Sunday they prayed for
that girl who had a baby? No!

“How did you find out, papa?” Bram heard himself saying from an
infinitely remote distance. He was shivering lest he should hear that
Jack Fleming had betrayed him.

“Because, thank the dear Lord, I have one son who knows his duty as a
Christian,” his father was saying.

Of course! Caleb had had a taste of tintack last night. No! No! No!
He could not give that little sneak the pleasure of gloating over his
punishment. No! The pictures of Blundell’s Diorama rolled across his
memory. Cobalt seas and marble halls, pagodas, palms ... twenty-five
shillings in his pocket and the world before him if he could only make
up his mind.

“Did you hear me tell you to go up to your bedroom, my boy?”

“Grandmamma, grandmamma, let me kiss you good-bye,” Bram cried by the
door.

The old lady drew near.

“Grandmamma,” he whispered as she folded him to her withered breast,
“I’m going to run away. Can you keep him in?”

Bram heard the key turn in the lock and a loud chuckle beyond the
closed door. Then he heard the sound of his father’s voice raised
in anger. Bram paused. Surely he would not strike grandmamma. He
listened a moment at the keyhole, smiled at what he heard his father
being called, and, blowing back a kiss to reach through the closed
door the old lady’s heart, hurried up to his room. But not to wait
there for his father to come with the blackthorn. No, just to throw
a few clothes into an old carpet-bag and a minute or two later to go
swinging out of Lebanon House for ever. On his way down the drive he
remembered that he had not licked Caleb for peaching. It was a pity to
let the little brute escape like that. He hesitated, decided that it
was not worth while to run the risk of being caught merely in order
to lick Caleb, and swung on down the drive. He had no plans, but he
had twenty-five shillings in his pocket, and there was a train to
Liverpool in half-an-hour. As a dissipation he had sometimes watched
its departure on the Sunday afternoons when he managed to escape from
Lebanon House and Bible readings, which was not often. Of course, there
would be plenty of people to tell his father where he had gone. But
Liverpool was a larger place than Brigham, and, if he could not get
taken on by the captain of an outward-bounder, he would be a stowaway.
Something would turn up. Bram hurried on. It was a good mile from
Lebanon House to the railway station. The booking-clerk stared through
his pigeon-hole when Bram asked for a single to Liverpool. The idlers
on the platform stared when they saw Bram Fuller, the grandson of the
great Caleb, shoulder his carpet-bag and enter the Liverpool train.
But Bram himself stared hardest of all when he found himself in a
compartment with Mr. Blundell of Blundell’s Diorama and the Sisters
Garibaldi.




                              CHAPTER VI

                              THE DIORAMA


Mr. Blundell did not believe in allowing the public to suffer in
ignorance of who he was. This was not merely due to a desire to
advertise himself and his goods. He was genuinely anxious to give
the public a treat, and his progress from town to town was a kind of
unlimited extension of the free-list. There he sat opposite Bram as if
the wooden seat of the third-class compartment were a Mexican saddle,
the train a bronco. On the other hand, the Sisters Garibaldi had lost
most of their exotic charm now that they were dressed like other women
in panniers and bustles instead of the ribbons and sequins of Southern
romance. What was left of it vanished for Bram when he heard one of
them say to the other in an unmistakably cockney accent:

“Did that masher in front send you the chocolates he promised, dear?”

“No, he didn’t, the wretch.”

“I told you he’d have to pawn his trousers before you ever saw those
chocolates, didn’t I, dear?”

“I wouldn’t like to say what you’ve told me and what you haven’t told
me, dear. You wag your tongue a good deal faster than what a dog wags
its tail.”

Mr. Blundell doffed his sombrero and revealed a head of hair that was
ridiculously out of keeping with that haystack of a moustache, for it
looked as if somebody had unwound the shining black twine from the
handle of a cricket bat and tried to wind it again with less than half
the quantity.

“Now, girlies,” he remonstrated in a fruity voice, “don’t make things
uncomfortable all around by arguing. Us men don’t like to see little
birdies pecking at one another. That’s right, isn’t it?”

This appeal was addressed to Bram, who smiled as politely as he knew
how and received in exchange a wink from Mr. Blundell so tremendous as
almost to give the impression that he had pulled down the curtain of
the compartment window and let it go up again with a snap.

“Going far?” he continued genially.

“Liverpool.”

“By thunder, so are we. The long arm again! You can’t get away from it
in this world. My name’s Blundell.”

This information was vouchsafed with an elaborate nonchalance.

“Unwin U. Blundell,” he added.

“I was enjoying the Diorama last night,” Bram said. “It was simply
splendid.”

“Ah, you were in front? Dainty little show, isn’t it? Instructive, yet
at the same time trees amusong as the Froggies say. Bright, but never
coarse. Rich, but never ostentatious. Funny thing, I suppose I’ve
knocked about the world more than most of us have, and yet I’ve always
set my face against anything the teeniest tottiest little bit coarse.
Did you notice I said my name was Unwin U. Blundell? Got me, as our
cousins the Americanos say? The initials by themselves would be coarse,
and my entertainment is refined from start to finish.”

One of the Sisters Garibaldi giggled.

“Now, Clara,” he said severely. “By the way, permit me, Miss Clara
Garibaldi, Miss Mona Garibaldi, Mr....”

“Bram Fuller.”

“No relation to Fuller’s Fireworks, I suppose?”

Bram explained that he was.

“By Jenkins, the long arm again! Why, only last week at Burton-on-Trent
I used a packet of Fuller’s squibs for the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
But I had to give it up. Yes, I found it frightened the women and
children too much. They were so shook by the effect that when the moon
rose behind the Alhambra they thought _that_ was going off with a bang
and started screaming again, so the fandango went rotten.”

“It certainly did,” the Sisters Garibaldi agreed in a huffy chorus.

“Coming back to my name,” said Mr. Blundell. “What do you think my
second name is? I’ll give you a sovereign if you can guess it in three.
That offer’s on tap to any stranger with who I have the pleasure of a
heart to heart. Give it up? I thought you would. Ursula!”

“But that’s a girl’s name, isn’t it?” Bram said in astonishment.

“Of course it is. But my dear old mother got it into her head that it
was a boy’s name. The parson argued with her. The sexton argued. The
godfathers and godmothers argued. The only one that didn’t argue was my
poor old dad, who knew better. So, Ursula I was christened, by thunder.
Unwin Ursula Blundell.”

The confidential manner of the showman invited confidence in return,
and before the train had puffed out of more than two of the stations
between Brigham and Liverpool he was in possession of Bram’s history.

“So you’re thinking of going to sea? It’s a hard life, my young friend.
Can’t you think of a better way of earning a living than rolling down
to Rio? What about the boards?”

Bram looked puzzled.

“The stage. The profession. Tragedy! Drama! Comedy! Farce!”

“Well, I’d like to be an actor,” said Bram eagerly. “But could I act?
My grandmater said I was a jolly good mimic.”

“There you are! What more do you want?”

“But aren’t I rather young?” Bram asked, in a sudden panic that he was
making a fool of himself. “I mean, who would give me anything to act?”

“That’s where Unwin U. Blundell enters, my young friend. Let’s figure
out your case. You want to keep out of the way of your father. You
don’t want to be hauled back to Brigham and set to work in an office.
Am I right?”

Bram nodded.

“So far, so good. Now we’re up against the long arm again. _I_ want
a young cannibal chief as an extra attraction for the Diorama. Why
shouldn’t you take on the job? It’ll mean staining yourself brown and
talking some kind of gibberish when I give the cue. I’ll stand you
in board and lodging and pay you five shillings a week for yourself.
What’s more, I’ll teach you how to look like a cannibal chief, and how
to act like a cannibal chief. I’d want a short war dance every night.
The girls will fake up something tasty there. Then before the show
begins you could shake hands with the audience at twopence a head.
Mind you don’t forget to shiver all the time. That’ll make the women
take an interest in you. But you mustn’t forget you’re a cannibal. If
anybody with a bit of ombongpong comes in to take a peep at you, you’ll
want to gloat some. You know what I mean? Look as if you was thinking
which was the best slice. That’ll go great. I _was_ thinking of touring
a big baboon, but a cannibal chief’s worth two baboons. Nothing
derogatory, if you follow my meaning. We’ll make you a prince, so as
you’ll be treated with respect. Prince Boo Boo. You want to give ’em a
nice easy name so as they can talk about it to their friends without
thinking that some Mr. Knowall in the corner’s going to jump up and
correct them all the time. Nobody could go wrong over a name like Boo
Boo. An infant in arms could say it. Prince Boo Boo, the world-famous
cannibal chief from the savage Solomon Islands. The youngest son of
the world-famous King Noo Noo who boasts of having eaten twenty-three
missionaries, nine traders, and fourteen shipwrecked mariners since he
ascended the throne. Prince Boo Boo himself was taken as a hostage for
the lives of three French sailors who had been captured by his father.
Unfortunately the king’s appetite was so ferocious and the sailors were
so fat that without thinking about his youngest son he went and ate the
lot. Prince Boo Boo was carried off to Europe where Unwin U. Blundell,
always on the quee vyve for novelties that will attract his many
patrons all over the civilised world, secured his exclusive services.
Come on, say the word, and we’ll get the bills printed and the costume
made in Liverpool, and on Monday week we’ll show ’em what’s what when
we open in St. Helens.”

The runaway did not hesitate. Mr. Blundell’s offer solved the problem
of his immediate future far more swiftly and far more easily than he
would ever have dared to hope.

Bram was a great success as a young cannibal chief. His natural shivers
during the excesses of an English summer filled the hearts of all
the women with the warmest sympathy, and a moment later the way he
gloated over imagined titbits of their anatomy made them shiver as
realistically as himself.

“It’s going great, laddie,” Unwin U. Blundell declared. “To rights,
it’s going. Props at the Royalty, Blackburn, who’s an old pal of mine,
is making me a two-pronged wooden fork, which was used by your dad,
King Noo Noo. With a bit of bullock’s blood we’ll have the ladies of
Bolton in a state of blue horrors next week. And if one of ’em faints,
laddie, there’s a shilling onto your salary when the ghost walks next
Friday night.”

The Sisters Garibaldi were inclined to be jealous of Bram at first,
but their feelings were appeased by being given a special new dance
in which they were dressed in costumes that looked like rag mats
trimmed with feather dusters, a dance that began with a seated swaying
movement and ended with wild leaps into the air to the accompaniment of
cannibalistic whoops.

Bram stayed with Unwin U. Blundell for nearly two years; but he did not
remain a young cannibal chief to the exclusion of everything else.

“It’s not good for any actor to play one part too long. My old granddad
was considered the finest Hamlet ever seen on the Doncaster circuit.
Well, I give you my word, after you’d heard him in ‘To be or not to
be,’ you didn’t know yourself if you were or if you weren’t. But he
played it too often, and he thought he’d vary things a bit by playing
Richard III and Macbeth on the Shakespeare nights. But it was too late.
He knew he’d waited too long the very first night he played Macbeth,
because instead of saying ‘Is this a dagger that I see before me?’ he
started off ‘Is this a bodkin that I see before me?’ It humiliated
him, poor old chap, and he gave up tragedy and took to farce, and that
killed him. Yes, it’s a mistake to get into a groove.”

So one day Prince Boo Boo disappeared from the programme of Blundell’s
Diorama and was succeeded by Wo Ho Wo, a Chinese philosopher. The
Celestial did not prove an attraction, and Wo Ho Wo soon gave place to
Carlo Marsala, the boy brigand of Sicily, a part which suited Bram to
perfection, so well indeed that the Sisters Garibaldi could not bear
it and were only persuaded to stay on with the Diorama by turning Bram
into a young Red Indian brave, and featuring him in a dance with his
two squaws before the tableau of Niagara.

In addition to the various geographical rôles he enacted with Unwin
U. Blundell, Bram learnt something about theatrical publicity, and
no doubt, if he had cared, he might have learnt from Mona and Clara
Garibaldi a good deal about love. Although their obvious inclination
to make him a bone of contention did not give Bram the least pleasure
or even afford him the slightest amusement, Mr. Blundell, who had
evidently been observing the pseudo-sisters becoming quite like real
sisters in the fierceness of their growing rivalry, ventured to utter a
few words of worldly admonition to the endangered swain.

“Don’t think I’m trying to interfere with you, laddie. But I’ve had so
much of that kind of thing myself, and I’d like to give you the benefit
of my experience. Never try and drive women in double harness. You
might as well try and drive tigers. They’ll start in fighting with each
other, but it’s _your_ head that’ll get bit off, that’s a cinch. I
wouldn’t be what I am now—Unwin U. Blundell of Blundell’s world-famous
Diorama—if I’d have let myself go galloping after the ladies. Two
whiskies, and a man’s a man. Two women, and he’s a miserable slave.
What does Bill Shakespeare say? ‘Give me the man that is not passion’s
slave.’ Take it from me, laddie, if Bill said that, he meant it. He’d
had some. That’s what I like about the One and Only. He’s had some of
everything.”

Bram assured Mr. Blundell that he well understood how easily a
young man could make a fool of himself and thanked him for his good
advice, which he followed so well during the whole of the time he was
travelling round Great Britain with the Diorama, that when at the end
of it he left to tread the legitimate boards he found that the Sisters
Garibaldi, if not sisters to each other, were wonderful sisters to him.

“I’m sorry to lose you, Bram,” said the showman when he was told of his
assistant’s engagement in a melodrama called _Secrets of a Great City_.
“But I won’t try and persuade you to stop. You’ve got the sawdust in
you, laddie. You’re likely to go far, if you stick to your work.”

“You’ve been a good friend to me, Mr. Blundell,” said Bram warmly.

“No man can wish to hear sweeter words than those,” the showman
replied: “You’ve listened to me every night spouting on antiquities,
old man. But the best antiquities in the whole blooming world are old
friends.”

The Sisters Garibaldi wept; Mr. Blundell blew his nose very hard; the
young actor passed into another sphere of theatrical life.

During the last two years Bram had written to his grandmother from
time to time, and had had from her an occasional letter in return, in
which he heard no news of Lebanon House beyond an occasional assurance
of its eternal sameness. However, just before he left Blundell to
join the melodrama company he did receive a letter, in which her large
spidery handwriting crossed and sometimes recrossed was spread over
several sheets of notepaper.

                                                     Lebanon House
                                                        Brigham.
                                                   April 20th, 1884.

  Dear Bram,

  I thought it might interest you to hear that your grandfather died
  last week. Please don’t write and tell me that you are sorry,
  because that would not be true and there is no need to make
  the death of a relation an occasion for an insincere piece of
  politeness. You will notice that there is no black edge to this
  notepaper. Remember that, when you next write to me. What is more,
  if there were any red ink in the house I would use it. Your brother
  is leaving school to take up a chair in your father’s office. There
  will not be room on the seat of that chair for anybody else. You
  need not worry that anybody in this house will ever try to kill the
  fatted calf for you. They wouldn’t give you a slice of cold mutton
  if you came back to-morrow. They wouldn’t give you a pickled onion.
  So stay where you are, and write sometimes to that withered leaf,

                                 Your loving
                                           Grandmother.

Bram made rapid strides in his profession—too rapid really, for by the
time he was twenty-three he already had a reputation in the provinces
as what was, and no doubt still is, known as a utility man. Such a
reputation, serviceable enough in the provinces, is likely to prove a
barrier to ultimate success. Paradox though it be, the better actor all
round a man is, the less likely he will be ever to achieve success in
London. It is the old tale of the general practitioner and the Harley
Street specialist. However, to be playing good parts at so early an age
was enough for Bram. He had no ambition to become famous for a novel
mannerism, and he was always ready to act anything—low comedy, light
comedy, heroes, villains, heavy fathers, and walking gentlemen. He was
never out of an engagement, and as he would have starved rather than
ask help of his relations, this was his chief concern. To fame and
fortune on a grand scale he did not aspire.




                              CHAPTER VII

                               TRUE LOVE


It was when Bram was twenty-three that he first found himself in the
same company as Nancy O’Finn. She was then a tall dark-haired girl of
eighteen with misted blue lakes for eyes and cheeks rose-burnt to the
sharp crimson of a daisy’s petals. Her voice with just a touch of a
brogue in it had the rich tones of a violoncello; her figure was what
was called fine in those days when women were not anxious to look as
if a steam-roller had passed over their bodies during the night. She
was with her father, Michael O’Finn, who had been supporting Mrs.
Hunter-Hart in heavies for fifteen years—ever since Mrs. Hunter-Hart
had set out to tour the provinces with a repertory of Shakespeare’s
comedies. Mrs. Hunter-Hart was now nearly fifty—some declared she
was several years over—but her Portia, her Viola, her Rosalind, her
Beatrice, and her Katherina, were ageless. This admirable veteran did
not fear the rivalry of youth. So here was Bram at twenty-three playing
Gratiano, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Corin, Verges, and Biondello, and Nancy
O’Finn at eighteen playing Nerissa, Maria, and Audrey. Indeed most of
Mrs. Hunter-Hart’s company, with the exception of Michael O’Finn and
herself, were under thirty. Bram was enjoying himself so much that out
of sheer good-will toward life he fell deep in love with Nancy. For a
while, everybody in the company watched the affair sympathetically.
Even Miss Hermione Duparc, the second lady, who had never understood
why Mrs. Hart had cast Nancy for the part of Nerissa and herself for
Jessica, was heard to murmur intensely that the little affair lent
quite a sparkle of romance to Spring in the Black Country and that it
was pretty to see the way those two children were enjoying themselves.
However, the affair presently became serious when the young lovers
announced that they were going to be married and Michael O’Finn woke up
to the fact that he was in danger of losing his only daughter.

“But, O’Finn, you’ve only had Nancy touring with you for a few months,”
Bram protested, when the heavy father, one hand thrust deep into
his buttoned frock-coat, strode up and down the unusually spacious
sitting-room he and Nancy were sharing that week in Birmingham, and
proceeded to give a performance of a character that had slipped between
King Lear and Shylock and fallen into melodrama.

“I had dreamed,” the old actor declaimed in a voice that rustled with
Irish foliage and was at the same time fruity with pompous tragic
tones, “I had dreamed of many harpy yeers before us, harpy, harpy yeers
in which I would behold my only daughter growing more like her beloved
mother whose loss has darkened the whole of my existence, since I laid
her to rest to wait for the last trump to ring out above the moil and
toil of Newcastle-on-Tyne. Young man, you have wounded a father in his
tenderest spot. You have shattered his hopes. You have torn the fibres
of his heart. In my mind’s eye I perceive my little daughter still
clutching at the dear maternal breast, and you blast that sacred vision
by proposing to commit matrimony with this tender suckling.”

“But, O’Finn, you didn’t object to her acting in other companies till
she was twelve years old; and for four years after that she lived with
an aunt in Dublin, so that you hardly ever saw her.”

“Young man, do not taunt an unhappy parent with what he has missed. She
and I were clutched by the iron hand of circumstance. The practical
considerations of finance ruled that we should live sundered until
now; but now, now at the very moment when the clouds are breaking to a
glorious day, you descend upon us like a thunderbolt out of a clear
sky and propose to marry this motherless child and drench the cheeks of
a stricken father with tears, idle tears.”

“But, O’Finn, Nancy isn’t as young as all that,” Bram protested.

“Spare your taunts, young man. I charge you, spare them. Be content
with the havoc you have wrought, but do not gloat like a vulture upon
the reeking ruins.”

“Look here, O’Finn, can’t we discuss this matter sensibly?”

“Sensibly?” cried the heavy father, throwing up his arms as a suppliant
at the throne of Heaven. “Sensibly? Ha-ha! Tarquin’s loathly form
steals into my domestic hearth and ravishes my daughter’s love, and
I, I the broken-hearted parent, am invited by the ravisher himself to
discuss the matter sensibly! Tempt me not to violence, young man. Do
not tempt me, I say. For twenty years, whenever I have had occasion to
visit the metropolis of the Midlands, I have stayed in Mrs. Prattman’s
comfortable lodgings without ever breaking so much as a humble egg-cup.
Do not tempt me to bring the whole house about my ears in the wild and
uncontrollable fury of despair.”

Bram began to laugh.

“He laughs! Ha-ha! He laughs! He surveys the havoc he has made and
laughs! A hyena wandering in a desert might abstain from laughter at
such a moment, but not this young man. No, no! _He_ laughs.”

“I’m really very sorry, O’Finn, but if you will go on talking like
that, I simply can’t help laughing.”

At this moment Nancy herself entered the sitting-room.

“Hello, boys, what’s the joke? Do tell a pal,” she cried in a radiance
of good-fellowship.

The heavy father sank down into one of Mrs. Prattman’s armchairs and
buried his head in his knees.

“It isn’t a joke at all, Nancy. It’s very serious. Your father won’t
hear of letting us get married, he says we’re too young.”

“The dear old duffer,” said Nancy. “Why, then we’ll just have to get
married without saying any more about it.”

“Never!” thundered the heavy father, springing to his feet.

“Then I’ll go back to Aunt Kathleen,” Nancy vowed. “If I’m old enough
to make love on the stage, I’m old enough to make love off it.”

Michael O’Finn, having taken up this attitude in his lodgings, could
not resist elaborating it before the performance in the cosy little
saloon bar of the “Saracen’s Head” just round the corner from the
stage-door. The result was that his delivery of Jacques’s great speech
in the Forest of Arden lost much of its austere melancholy and most
of its articles definite and indefinite. A pronounced thickening of
all the sibilants with a quantity of unnecessary tears left Jacques
himself, at the end of that strange eventful history, in a state of
mere oblivion and apparently sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans
everything. When the curtain fell on the second act, Mrs. Hunter-Hart,
who had been watching him from the wings, invited her heavy man to step
up to her dressing-room and explain what he meant by it.

“I am ecsheedingly dishtreshed, Mrs. Hart, but a domeshtic mishfortune
overtook me thish afternoon and I’m afraid that I drank rather more
than wash good for me in the ‘Sharashen’s Head.’”

He proceeded to give Mrs. Hunter-Hart an account of the shock which had
led him into such unprofessional conduct.

“O’Finn, I’m astonished at you! I would not believe that a man of your
age could make such an unmitigated ass of himself. Come, let me try you
with your cues.

“_Even a toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered._”

“_Will you be married, motley?_” O’Finn muttered thickly.

“_As the ox hath his bow, sir_,” Mrs. Hart went on, “_the horse his
curb, and the falcon her bells, so hath man his desires; and as
pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling_.”

“Yes, I perceive the point you’re making, ma’am,” the old actor
admitted. “But with your permission I would....”

“Beginners third act,” cried the junior member of the company, hurrying
along the stone corridors past the dressing-room doors.

Perhaps if the interval had been longer, Mrs. Hunter-Hart might
have persuaded Michael O’Finn that he was behaving unreasonably and
absurdly. As it was, he recovered his sense of outraged paternity, and
on the following night he worked up his feelings in the bar of the
“Saracen’s Head” to such a pitch that several members of the company
began to think that Bram really must have been behaving rather badly
with Nancy. O’Finn played Sir Toby Belch that night, and, as the
_Birmingham Daily Post_ said, it was probably as ripe a performance as
had ever been seen on any stage.

However, what had begun not exactly in jest, but to some extent as
a piece of play-acting, became serious; for Michael O’Finn, who had
nearly ruined his youthful career by hard drinking, seemed inclined
to revert to the wretched habit in his maturity. Bram began to feel
thoroughly upset, in spite of Nancy’s protestations of undying love and
her promise to run away and be married to him the moment he gave the
word. Mrs. Hunter-Hart herself continued to be kind, and was always
assuring them of her great influence over the intransigent father and
of the certainty that he would soon come to his senses. The rest of
the company was on the whole unfavourable to the lovers, so sad was
the picture that O’Finn drew of a desolate future bereft of his only
daughter and doomed for ever to tour the provinces in lonely lodgings
without being allowed to buy that little cottage in the country,
where with Nancy in affectionate ministration he was to rest during
the rose-hung Junes of conventional idealism, and to which he was
ultimately to retire on his savings for a peaceful pipe-smoking old
age. As a matter of hard fact, Michael O’Finn had exactly two weeks’
salary in his bank, barely enough to pay the lawyer for the conveyance
of a two-roomed bungalow on the banks of the Thames.

A week or two later in the middle of this situation Bram received a
letter from his grandmother:

                                                     Lebanon House
                                                        Brigham.
                                                     May 31st, 1889.

  Dear Bram,

  Your father is dead. He was humbly presenting a loyal address to
  the Duke of Edinburgh and having always had, as you know, a wretched
  crop of hair, he caught a cold which developed into pneumonia, and
  that’s the end of my son Joshua. I understand that Caleb is the
  sole heir subject to certain annuities payable to your aunts and an
  injunction not to let his mother starve. You are not mentioned in
  the will. However, since Caleb won’t come of age for a month or two,
  the executors (neither of whom are Peculiars) think that, if you
  were to return home immediately, pressure could be brought to bear
  on your brother to come to an equitable arrangement by which, if you
  consented to devote yourself to the business, you should be made a
  partner in the firm. It lies with you, my dear boy. Is it worth while
  to make yourself pleasant to that sleek Jacob for the sake of perhaps
  a thousand pounds a year (I don’t think you’d get more out of it),
  or would you prefer to remain poor, free, and honest? I know which I
  should choose if I were you. You know that I would like to see you
  before I die, though I’m bound to say that at the present there is
  no sign of my dying. More’s the pity, for I am heartily sick of this
  life, and though I admit I am now faced with the dread of another
  much longer one hereafter, I’m hoping that the rumour prevalent about
  eternity has been grossly exaggerated. I rarely leave my own room
  nowadays, and my eyes have been giving me a good deal of trouble,
  so that I find it almost impossible to read. However, luckily I
  have unearthed in Brigham a pleasant young woman with a respect for
  commas and colons who reads aloud to me in a not quite intolerable
  French. She winces at Zola, but then so do I, for he’s such a rank
  bad writer. Nevertheless, I cannot resist the rascal just as once
  upon a time I could never resist staring into shop windows. How your
  grandfather hated that habit of mine! He never knew what it might
  lead to. People feel the same about Zola, I suppose. Strange your
  father dying abruptly like this. I had figured him as a perpetual
  phenomenon like the smoke of the Brigham chimneys. If you _do_ decide
  to come home, you should come quickly.

                                  Your loving
                                           Grandmother.

Bram contemplated the sheets of sprawling spidery handwriting and
wondered what he ought to do. His grandmother did not know what a
problem she was putting before him. It was not so easy to laugh at the
idea of a thousand pounds a year, now that he was engaged to Nancy. A
settled prospect was likely to make her father take another view of
their marriage. It would be deuced hard to eat humble-pie to Caleb, but
with Nancy as a reward he could achieve even that. And life in Brigham?
Ugh! Well, even life in Brigham with Nancy laughing beside him would be
sweeter and lovelier than life in Paradise without her.

He showed the letter to his sweetheart and asked her advice.
Afterwards, he used to wonder how he could ever have doubted for a
moment what her answer would be.

“Go home?” she exclaimed. “Why, Bram darling, you must be mad to
think of such a thing. What’s a thousand a year compared with your
self-respect?”

“I thought your father might take a more reasonable view of our
marriage, if I could be doing something more solid than acting in the
provinces.”

“Has _he_ ever done anything more solid himself? Never in his life.
Well, listen to me, Bram, if you go back home and crawl to that brother
of yours, I swear I’ll break off our engagement. Now there it is
straight.”

“You know there’s only one reason would make me go home.”

“Well, you’ll have to marry a squib, my dear, for you’ll certainly
never marry your Nancy if you do.”

“There doesn’t seem much chance of my ever marrying you as things are
now,” Bram sighed.

“Will you elope? Now listen to me, I’m serious. I’m after thinking that
an elopement is the only solution for us. What is it Touchstone sings
to Audrey:

    Come, sweet Audrey:
    We must be married, or we must live in bawdry!

At least he doesn’t sing it in our version, because dear old Ma Hart
is so damned genteel she wouldn’t have such a sentiment uttered by a
member of her pure company. But it’s in Shakespeare, for I read it when
I was studying the part.”

“But your father, you lunatic?”

“Och, my father! He can’t drink any more than he’s drinking now, and
it would give him a gentlemanly excuse for getting drunk if he was to
celebrate his daughter’s wedding. Listen. You’ve enough money to buy
the ring and the license?”

“Oh, I’ve saved twelve pounds this tour already.”

“Next week’s Leamington and Coventry, and the week after’s Leicester.
Let’s be married in Leicester on Saturday week. That’s the only way
to deal with father, and indeed it’s a kindness to the man, for he’s
getting tired of playing the ill-used father, and a little bit of
geniality for a change will do him all the good in the world.”

Bram caught her to him.

“You won’t regret it, Nancy?”

“Why should I regret it?”

“You shan’t, you shan’t, dear Nancy. Listen, I haven’t said anything
about this before, because I didn’t want to give you the idea that I
was trying to make a bargain over you. But I don’t believe in mixed
marriages, and I think I’d like to be a Catholic. My grandmother’s a
Catholic, you know, and she’s the only creature in the world I really
care for, except you, my sweetheart.”

“Ah, now, don’t think it’s so easy to become a Catholic. You’ll have to
have the devil’s own amount of instruction first. You can be married
without knowing a thing at all about it. But the priest won’t baptise
you so easy as he’ll marry you. Conversion can wait till we have a
little more time to ourselves.”

So, on the sixteenth of June at Leicester Bram and Nancy were married.
The ceremony achieved, they went for a long drive in a fly through the
not very beautiful Leicestershire country and arrived back at Michael
O’Finn’s lodgings about five o’clock to announce the state of affairs
at the favourable hour when he should be digesting his dinner over a
cigar. It was the last evening of the tour and _Twelfth Night_ was
in the bill, so that, if he should go out and get drunk before the
performance, he was less likely to disgrace himself as obviously as in
any of his other parts.

“Well, we’ve done it, father,” Nancy began.

“Done what?” he demanded, crackling the leaves of _The Stage_ and
scowling at Bram over the top of it.

“We’re married. Yes, we were married in St. Aloysius’ Church this
morning at twelve o’clock. There’s nothing to be done about it, father.”

“Nothing to be done about it?” repeated O’Finn. “There is a very great
deal to be done. Come to my arms, my beloved child. Weep upon my
shoulder in the excess of your new-found happiness. Weep, I say. Spare
not one single tear. Weep, weep. Young man, give me your hand. I have
entrusted you with the guardianship of the being I hold most sacred of
earth’s creatures. Honour that trust, young man. Rejoice a father’s
heart by your devotion. God bless you both, my children. And now let
us make arrangements to celebrate this auspicious event by a supper to
our friends and intimates at that best of hostelries, the old ‘Blue
Boar.’ There is not a moment to be lost. Mine host will want to make
his arrangements with the authorities for an extension of the license
to some seasonable small hour that will suitably hallow the occasion. I
will leave you here to bill and coo. Did you see what _The Stage_ said
about my Tranio this week? Read it, my boy. You’ll be delighted with
the way the notice is written. Judicial—very, very judicial.”

With this O’Finn, humming the _Wedding March_ in his rich bass, left
the newly wed pair to themselves.

“Well, I’m bothered,” Bram gasped. “He’s completely turned round.”

“I rather thought he would,” Nancy said. “I’ve never known him refuse a
fat part. He was getting tired of gloom.”

When Nancy and Bram went down to the theatre that night, O’Finn met
them at the stage-door, beaming with good-will.

“I’ve seen my dear old manageress. She has consented to grace the
festivity in person, and the acting-manager of the theatre has insisted
on our using the green-room. The supper is being sent in from the ‘Blue
Boar.’ Ham. Chicken. Lobster. All the appropriate delicacies. Several
of the orchestra are coming. Very jolly fellows. We’ll have some
capital fiddling. My dear old pal Charlie Warburton will give us Hood’s
_Bridge of Sighs_, and I daresay we can persuade him into _Eugene Aram_
as well. I’ve asked Mrs. Hart to recite us one of her gems. In fact,
the whole crowd will oblige. We are going to make a memorable night of
it. You couldn’t have chosen a better time to get married. We’ve had
a splendid Whitweek, and that showery Whit Monday put Mrs. H.-H. into
such a delightful humour. The last day of the tour. By gad, girl, I’m
proud to be your poor old father. And the booking to-night is splendid,
I hear. We shall have a bumper house for _Twelfth Night_.”

It was a merry evening in the old green-room of the Opera House,
Leicester, now, alas! fallen from its companionable status and turned
to some practical and business-like purpose. Gilded mirrors on the
walls, glittering gasoliers, bright silver, and shining faces, warmth
and happiness of careless human beings gathered together for a few
hours in fellowship, all are vanished now. Files and dockets and
roll-top desks have replaced them.

There is no doubt that the central figure on that genial night was
Michael O’Finn. The bride and bridegroom were teased and toasted,
but the central figure was the erstwhile dejected father. How many
speeches he made it would be hard to say, but he certainly made a
very great many. He proposed everybody’s health in turn, and when
everybody’s health had been proposed and drunk, he proposed corporate
bodies like the theatre orchestra, the town council of Leicester, and
Mrs. Hunter-Hart’s Shakespearian Company. And when he had exhausted
the living he sought among the dead for his toasts, raising his glass
to the memory of Will Shakespeare, Davy Garrick, Ned Kean, and Mrs.
Siddons. When the mighty dead were sufficiently extolled he proposed
abstractions like Art and the Drama. His final speech was made about
four o’clock in the morning—to the memory of the happy days, old
friends, and jolly companions.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you will agree with me that we
have all spent a very enjoyable and—er—delightful evening. Those who
have not, hold up their hands. As I suspected _nemine contradicente_,
carried unam.... But there is one more toast to which I will invite
you to raise your glasses. Ladies and gentlemen, another night of our
earthly pilgrimage has waned. The sun of to-morrow already gilds the
horizon, though we may still seem to be living in to-night. We have
all wished long life and happiness to my beloved daughter and the
excellent young man—may I add excellent young actor—who has—er—joined
his future with hers, in short, who has married her. But there is yet
another toast to which I must bid you raise your glasses. Ladies and
gentlemen, we have reached the end of a happy tour with my dear old
friend and manageress, Mrs. Hunter-Hart. Some of us will meet again
under her banner in the last week of July on the sunny South Coast;
others will not. We shall probably never find ourselves all together
at the same festive board. Let me beg you therefore to drink all
together, for perhaps the last time in this mortal life, to the toast
of happy days and sweet memories, old friends and jolly companions.
Ladies and gentlemen, I confess without shame that a teardrop lurking
in the corner of my eye has coursed down my cheek and alighted upon the
lapel of my coat as I give you this solemn toast. Happy memories! What
a world of beautiful images those two words conjure up! I see again
the little cradle in which my mother rocked me to sleep. I kneel once
more by her knees to say my childish prayers. Anon I am a happy urchin
tripping and gambolling down the lane to the village school. Anon I
stand before the altar with my dearly beloved and alas! now for ever
absent wife beside me. I hear once more the vociferous plaudits of the
crowded pit as I cry to Macbeth, ‘Turn, hell-hound, turn.’ I live again
through the delightful moments of first meeting my dear old friend and
manageress, Emmeline Hunter-Hart, who has upheld the banner of the
legitimate drama against odds, ladies and gentlemen, odds, fearful,
tremendous, overwhelming odds. She has seen on all sides the hosts of
evil in the shape of these vile problem plays that have degraded, are
degrading, and will continue to degrade the sacred fane of Thespis.
Happy memories, ladies and gentlemen! And surely I may ask you to count
this night as one of your happiest memories. To the young couple who
this morning resolved to face the storms of life together, surely this
night will be a happy memory. Happy memories and—let us not forget
them—old friends, for are not all our happiest memories bound up with
old friends? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the double toast to which
I hope you will accord full musical honours by joining with me in
singing friendship’s national anthem, the moving song of the immortal
Robbie Burns, _Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot_.”

The party broke up. The footsteps of the company died away along the
cobbled streets of Leicester. The night became a happy memory. The
bride and bridegroom went dreaming homeward, life before them, the dewy
freshness of June around them, and overhead the faded azure of the
empty morning sky.




                             CHAPTER VIII

                         ROGUES AND VAGABONDS


The first thing that Bram and Nancy vowed to each other was that they
would never accept anything but a joint engagement. It sounded so easy
at first, but during the next four years many anxious moments were
caused by that rose-flushed resolution of early married life. However,
they did manage it, and not only that but they managed somehow to take
with them on tour the baby girl who was born on the sixteenth of July,
just a year and a month after they were married.

Letizia was born in a tiny cottage buried among the cherry orchards of
Kent. The original Letizia’s letter on being informed of the proposed
tribute to herself was characteristic:

                                                     Lebanon House
                                                        Brigham.
                                                    July 20th, 1890.

  Dear Bram,

  Why you should burden your wretched infant with the name that
  nearly eighty years ago was so unsuitably bestowed upon her
  great-grandmother I cannot imagine. I hope that the challenge you
  offer to Fate by calling any child Gladness will not be vented on
  her head.

  Lying here in bed, for I am become a bedridden old bag of bones, I
  look back at my wasted life and wonder why it should be prolonged in
  this unreasonable manner. Letizia! Did either of you young people
  realise that Letizia means gladness? However, as you insist on an
  exchange of compliments between this poor infant and myself, why, let
  your wife kiss her with her own fresh lips and tell her that once
  the lips of another Letizia were as fresh. I have just picked up
  the mirror and looked at myself. When I die, ah, _mon dieu_, when,
  when ... let me be crumpled up and flung into the nearest wastepaper
  basket.

                             Your affectionate ancestor,
                                              Letizia the First.

  By the way, I don’t think I’ve written since Master Caleb celebrated
  his coming of age by sacking all of the older workmen in the factory
  three months after they presented him with a token of esteem and
  respect. I understand they were informed that he only took this step
  for their own good, because he was afraid that they were getting too
  old for the dangerous trade of making rockets! The Peculiars made an
  attempt to recapture him from the Church of England (in which your
  father had recently invested) by offering him a vacant apostolic
  seat. Caleb replied that he could not see his way to occupy such a
  position satisfactorily. True enough, for his behind has swollen like
  a pumpkin in the sun. The pleasant-faced young woman who reads aloud
  to me is a most capable gossip. I am getting a new insight into local
  affairs.

Nancy wished that she could meet this strange old woman whose fierce
blood ran in the veins of the raspberry-coloured monkey at her breast
that was growing daily so much more like a human being. But she and
Bram agreed that it would be foolish to involve themselves in the
domesticity either of his family or of hers. They must only have one
aim, and that must be the joint engagement.

“Once we separate, things will never be the same again,” Nancy said.

“Oh, don’t I know it, dearest! But we won’t separate.”

Nor did they. Difficult though it was sometimes, they did always manage
to keep together, those rogues and vagabonds, and what is more they did
manage to keep Letizia with them.

“I wonder you don’t let your little girl stay with some relation while
you’re on tour,” a jealous mother would observe.

“I like to have her with me during these first years. Time enough to
lose her when she goes to school,” Nancy would reply.

“But surely the continual change and travelling cannot be good for so
young a child?” the critic would insist.

“I think change of air is good for everything,” Nancy would reply
firmly.

So, up and down the length of England, in and out of Wales, across
to Ireland and over the border to Scotland, for the next four years
Bram and Nancy wandered. In every new company the first thing they
pitched was Letizia’s canvas travelling-cot with its long poles and
short poles and cross pieces and canopy which all fitted ingeniously
together until the final business of lacing up the back like a pair
of stays was finished and Letizia was tucked away inside. Always the
same luggage—the tin bath packed so full of Nancy’s clothes that it
was a great struggle to fasten it—Bram’s second-hand portmanteau with
its flap like an elephant’s ear and bulging middle—the trim wicker
luncheon-basket, and big wicker theatrical-basket smelling of grease
paint and American cloth and old wigs. Endless journeys on Sundays in
trains without corridors and on some lines still lighted with oil-lamps
so that the baby Letizia, lying on the horsehair cushions of the
railway-carriage, would drop asleep to the rhythmic movement of the oil
swaying to and fro in the glass container. Long waits at stations like
York and Crewe, where the only Sabbath traffic in those days seemed to
be touring companies and all the compartments in all the trains were
labelled engaged. Long waits while stout men with red noses and blue
chins greeted old pals and ran up and down the length of the train,
and cracked jokes over flasks of whisky or brandy. Long waits in big
smoky junctions, sometimes catching sight of the _Dorothy_ company with
its pack of hounds—to the great excitement and joy of Letizia, who
would be held up to admire the barking of the bow-wows. Late arrivals
in smoky northern towns when the only fly at the station would be
collared by the manager and the humbler members of the company would
have to shoulder their light luggage and walk to their lodgings. Late
arrivals in snowstorm and rainstorm, in fog and frost, when the letter
ordering the meal had miscarried and the landlady was a gaunt stranger
who thoroughly enjoyed telling the weary vagabonds that, not having
heard from them, she had not lighted the fire in the sitting-room. Late
arrivals when the landlady was an old friend and came down the steps
to embrace both her lodgers and lead them into a toasting, glowing
room with the table laid and a smell of soup being wafted along the
little passage from the kitchen. Early morning starts when every lady
in Nancy’s carriage wanted a different corner and signified her choice
with an exaggerated and liverish politeness. Early morning starts when
some familiar little thing was left behind and the next lodgings did
not look like home until the missing article was forwarded on from the
last town. Every week a new town, and sometimes two or three small
towns in one week. Every Monday morning at eleven a music call, and
after that a walk round the new town to discover the best and cheapest
shops. Every day dinner at three o’clock and tea at six. Every evening
Letizia left to the guardianship of the landlady while Bram and Nancy
set out arm-in-arm to the theatre. Every night except Sunday the swing
of a dingy door and the immemorial smell of the theatre within. Our
modern young actors and actresses do not know that smell. It vanished
in its perfection when electric light took the place of gas, and
unretentive encaustic tiles lined the corridors instead of bare stone
or whitewashed bricks. It requires something more than the warmth of
hot-water pipes to ripen and conserve that smell. It may have lost
some of its quintessential peculiarity when gas supplemented candles;
but those gas-jets covered with wire guards, on which the ladies and
gentlemen of visiting companies were requested by the management not to
boil kettles, must have added a beautiful richness of their own.

Thou glorious ancient smell of the theatre, thou sublime pot-pourri of
grease-paint, wig-paste, vaseline, powder, perspiration, old clothes,
oranges, tobacco, gas, drains, hair, whitewash, hot metal, and dusty
canvas, where mayest thou still be savoured instead of that dull odour
of Condy’s fluid and fire extinguishers which faintly repels us as we
pass through the stage-doors of our contemporary palaces of amusement?

                   *       *       *       *       *

Our particular vagabonds found it easier to obtain joint engagements
in musical shows. Nancy’s contralto voice, untrained though it was,
grew better and better each year, and Bram had developed into a capital
comedian. In the third and fourth winters after they were married they
played together in pantomime, and for the Christmas season of 1894
they were engaged at the Theatre Royal, Greenwich—Bram as Idle Jack
in _Dick Whittington_ and Clown in the Harlequinade, Nancy as Fairy
Queen and Columbine. It was a pity that by now the Harlequinade was
already a moribund form of entertainment, for Bram had a genuine talent
for getting that fantastic street-life over the footlights. One may
be allowed a fleeting suspicion that the English stage has lost more
than it has gained by its banishment of the clown from its boards. The
French, who are dramatically so much superior, have preserved their
clowns.

Bram and Nancy found exceptionally pleasant lodgings in Greenwich.
Starboard Alley was a row of diminutive Georgian houses running down
to the river and overlooking at the back the grounds of the Trinity
Hospital. The bow windows which gave just such a peep of the wide
Thames as one may get of the sea itself in little streets that lead
down to ancient harbours, had no more than a genteel and unobtrusive
curve; it was the very place in which an outward-bound mariner would
have felt safe in leaving his wife to wait for his return. Starboard
Alley was too narrow for vehicles, so that there was never any sound
there but of the footsteps of people walking past on their way to
stroll along the embankment above the river—a pleasant place, that
embankment, even in this cold December weather, with the seagulls
wheeling and screaming overhead and the great ships coming home on
the tide, coming home for Christmas on the flowing tide. Not only was
the house in Starboard Alley itself attractive, but Mrs. Pottage, the
landlady, was as much a feature of it as the bow window, though, to say
truth, she had a more obtrusive curve. She was a widow of forty years’
standing, her husband, a gunner in one of Her Majesty’s ships having
been killed off Sebastopol; but she was still comely with her fresh
complexion and twinkling eyes, and her heart was young.

“I was hardly eighteen at the time my poor husband vanished out of
this world,” she told her lodgers, “and the offers of marriage I’ve
had since—well, I assure you the men have always been round me like
flies after sugar. But I’ve never melted like sugar does in the heat. I
said ‘no’ to the first in 1855 within four months of my pore William’s
death—well, it was death and burial all in one as you might say,
because he’d been talking to his mate as cheerful as a goldfinch the
moment before and the next moment there was nothing of him left. It
was his mate I said ‘no’ to, four months later, when he was invalided
home with a wooden leg. He was the first, and I said ‘no’ to the last
only yesterday afternoon just before tea—a Mr. Hopkins he is, a ship’s
chandler in a small style of business with a head like the dome of the
Observatory, but no more in it than an empty eggshell. Oh, I ashore
you I gave him a very firm ‘no,’ and he went back to his chandling as
dumb as a doornail. Yes, you might really call it quite a hobby of
mine refusing eligibles. I used to put the dates down in the butcher’s
book or the baker’s book as the case might be, but I got charged for
them one year as extra loaves and ever since then I’ve kept the dates
in my head. Off to rehearsal now, are you? Well, fancy them having
a rehearsal on Christmas Eve. I call that making a great demand on
anybody’s good nature. In fact, if anybody didn’t mind being a bit
vulgar, it’s what they might call blooming sauce. And you’ll leave your
little girl with me? What’s her name, Letishyer? Said with a sneeze, I
suppose? Never mind, I’ll enjoy having her hanging on to my skirts. I
never had no children myself. Well, I was just getting over the first
shyness and beginning to enjoy married life when all of a sudden that
Crimeen war broke out and my poor William had to leave me. Well, it
was a mean crime, and no mistake. Got to start off to the theatre now?
Wrap yourselves up well, for it’s biting cold to-night. It’s my opinion
we’re in for a real old-fashioned Christmas. Good job, too, I say, the
size women are wearing their sleeves nowadays. Balloon sleeves they
call them. Balloonatic sleeves I should say. Well, toora-loora!! I’ll
pop your little girl into her cot and have the kettle on the boil for
you when you come back. Ugh! What a perishing evening!”

The vagabonds arm-in-arm set out toward the theatre, the north wind
blowing fiercely up Starboard Alley across the Thames from Barking
Flats—a searching wind, fierce and bitter.

The _Dick Whittington_ company had been rehearsing hard during the
previous week, and now two days before the production on Boxing Day
it was seeming incredible that the management would ever have the
impudence to demand the public’s money to see such a hopelessly
inadequate performance.

“We’ve been in some bad shows, my dear,” Bram said to Nancy on their
way to the theatre, “but I think this is the worst.”

“I’m too tired to know anything about it. But your songs will go all
right, I’m sure.”

He shook his head doubtfully.

“Yes, but that fellow Sturt who plays the Dame is a naughty actor. He
really is dire. I simply cannot get him to work in with me. That’s the
worst of taking a fellow from the Halls. He hasn’t an elementary notion
how to help other people. He can’t see that it takes two people to make
a scene funny.”

“Never mind,” said Nancy, yawning. “It’ll all be splendid, I expect, on
Wednesday. Oh, dear, I am tired. They’ve given you a good trap-act in
the Harlequinade.”

“Yes, that’s all right. But do you know, Nancy, it’s a queer thing, but
I funk trap-acts. I’m never happy till I’ve gone through the last one.”
He stopped short and struck his forehead. “Great Scott!”

“What is the matter?”

“We haven’t got anything for Letizia’s stocking?”

“Bram!”

“What time were we called again?”

“Six o’clock.”

“Look here,” he said, “you go round and collect some toys from a
toyshop. I’ll make an excuse to Worsley if by any chance he wants
the Fairy Queen at the beginning. But he won’t. He wants to get the
shipwreck right. We shall probably be on that till nearly midnight.”

So Nancy left Bram at the stage-door and went on to do her shopping.
The streets were crowded with people, and in spite of the cold wind
everybody was looking cheerful. The shops, too, with their brightly lit
windows all decorated with frosted cotton-wool and holly, exhaled that
authentic Christmas glow, which touches all but hearts too long barren
and heads too long empty. The man who sneers at Christmas is fair game
for the Father of Lies.

Nancy revelled in the atmosphere, and for a while she allowed herself
to drift with the throng—hearing in a dream the shrill excited cries of
the children, the noise of toy instruments, the shouts of the salesmen
offering turkeys and geese; smelling in a dream that peculiar odour of
hung poultry mixed with crystallised fruit, oranges, and sawdust; and
perceiving in a dream the accumulated emotion of people who were all
thinking what they could buy for others, that strange and stirring
emotion which long ago shepherds personified as a troop of angels
crying, “Peace, good-will toward men.” She felt that she could have
wandered happily along like this for hours, and she was filled with
joy to think that in a short while she should be welcomed by some of
these children as the Spirit of Good. The part of the Fairy Queen had
never hitherto appealed to her; but now suddenly she was seized with
a longing to wave her silver wand and vanquish the Demon King. She
passed four ragged children who were staring at a heap of vivid sweets
on the other side of a plate-glass window. She went into the shop and
bought a bagful for each. It was wonderful to pass on and leave them
standing there on the pavement in a rapture of slow degustation. But
her time could not be spent in abandoning herself to these sudden
impulses of sentimental self-indulgence. She entered a bazaar and
filled her bag with small toys for Letizia’s stocking—a woolly lamb,
a monkey-on-a-stick, a tin trumpet, a parti-coloured ball—all the
time-honoured cargo of Santa Claus. She had already bought a case
of pipes for Bram’s Christmas present. But now she was filled with
ambition to give him some specially chosen gift that would commemorate
this cold Greenwich Yuletide. What should it be? She longed to find
something that would prove to him more intimately than words all that
he had meant to her these years of their married life, all that he
would mean to her on and on through the years to come. Bram was such a
dear. He worked so hard. He was never jealous. He had nothing of the
actor’s vanity, and all the actor’s good nature. What present would
express what she felt about his dearness? Ash-trays, cigarette-holders,
walking-sticks—what availed they to tell him how deep was her love?
Pocket-books, card-cases, blotters—what eloquence did they possess?
Then she saw on the counter a little silver key.

“Is this the key of anything?” she asked the shopman.

“No, miss, that is what they call a charm. We have a large assortment
this season. This silver puppy-dog, for instance. You’d really be
surprised to know what a quantity of these silver puppy-dogs we’ve
sold. They’re worn on bracelets or watch-chains. Quite the go, miss, I
can assure you.”

“No, I like this key better. Could you let me have a box for it?”

“Certainly, miss.”

“And I want to write something on a card and put it inside if you’d
kindly seal it for me.”

“With pleasure, miss.”

Nancy leant over the counter and wrote, with a blush for her folly:
_This is the key of my heart. Keep it always, my darling._

The key and the card were put inside the box; and she hurried off to
the theatre, laughing to herself in an absurdly delicious excitement at
the thought of hiding it under Bram’s pillow to-night.

The dress rehearsal was not over till three o’clock on Christmas
morning. The ladies and gentlemen of the company were all so tired when
at last they were dismissed that when they came out of the theatre and
found Greenwich white and silent under a heavy fall of snow, not even
the comedians had any energy to be funny with snowballs.

“What time’s the call to-morrow, dear?” one of the chorus called back
to a friend in a weary voice.

“There’s no call to-morrow, duck. It’s Christmas Day.”

“Gard, so it is!”

“Don’t forget the curtain goes up for the matinée on Boxing Day at
half-past one, dear.”

“Right-o!”

“Queenie’s got her boy staying at the ‘Ship,’” the chorus girl
explained to Nancy. “And she’s the limit for forgetting everything when
he’s about. She’s potty on him. Merry Christmas, Miss O’Finn.”

“Merry Christmas to you.”

All the way back up the court, at the end of which was the stage-door,
the Christmas greetings of one to another floated thinly along the
snowy air.

“A merry Christmas! A merry Christmas.”

Bram took Nancy’s arm, and they hurried away back as fast as they could
to Starboard Alley, where they found Letizia safe in her cot, one of
Mrs. Pottage’s stockings hanging like a coal-sack over the foot of it.

“You never told me which stocking to put out,” said the landlady. “So I
hung up one of my own. Of course, I hung up one of hers as well, pore
mite, but hers wouldn’t hold more than a couple of acid-drops. Mine is
a _little_ more convenient.”

“How kind of you to sit up for us, Mrs. Pottage,” the two vagabonds
exclaimed.

“Oh, I’ve been thinking over old times. You know. On and off the doze,
as you might say. My friend Mrs. Bugbird didn’t hop it till past
midnight. She generally comes in for a chat of a Monday evening, and
being Christmas Eve she stayed on a bit extra. She’s a real comic, is
Mrs. Bugbird; but she had to be a bit careful how she laughed to-night,
because last week she ricked the plate of her teeth laughing over a
story I told her. Yes, the soup’s lovely and hot. But I did let the
fire out in your sitting-room. So if you wouldn’t mind coming into my
kitchen....”

“Was Letizia good?” the mother asked.

“She hasn’t moved an inch since I put her to bye-bye. I’ve popped up
to look at her several times. In fact, Mrs. Bugbird and me both popped
up, and Mrs. B. said a more sweetly pretty infant she never did wish
to see. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘Mrs. Bugbird,’ I said, ‘that’s something for
you to say with the fourteen you’ve had.’ Fancy, fourteen! Tut-tut-tut!
Still if I’d accepted half my proposals, I’d have had more like forty
by now.”

A canary stirred upon his perch and chirped.

“Hear that?” said Mrs. Pottage. “That blessed bird understands every
word I say. Don’t you, my beauty? Now come along, drink up your soup,
and do eat a little bit of the nice cold supper I’ve put out for you.”

While her lodgers were enjoying the cold roast beef, Mrs. Pottage
examined the purchases made for Letizia’s stocking.

“Oh, dear, how they do get things up nowadays!” she exclaimed, holding
at admiring arm’s length the monkey-on-a-stick. “Lifelike, isn’t it?
You’ll want an orange and an apple, don’t forget. And I wouldn’t put
in too many lollipops if I was you, or she won’t be able to eat any
turkey. I got you a lovely little turkey. Nine pounds. Well, you don’t
want to sit down to an elephant. I remember one Christmas I invited
my sister to come up from Essex, and I thought she’d appreciate some
turkey, so I told the fishmonger to send in a really nice dainty
little one. Well, by mistake his boy brought round one that weighed
thirty-two pounds and which had won the prize for the biggest turkey
in Greenwich that year. In fact, it come round to me with a red and
white rosette stuck in its how-d’ye-do as big as a sunflower. Well, it
didn’t arrive till past eleven o’clock on Christmas Eve, and I was down
at the ‘Nelson’s Head’ with my sister till closing time, and there it
was waiting for us when we got back, tied onto the knocker. It gave
me a bit of a start, because I’d had one or two for old sake’s sake,
and I thought for the minute some pore fellow had gone and suicided
himself on my front door. Well, there was nothing to be done but cook
it, and my sister’s a small-made woman, and when we sat down to dinner
with that turkey between us she might have been sitting one side of
St. Paul’s and me the other. I give you my word that turkey lasted me
for weeks. Well, the wish-bone was as big as a church window, and I
could have hung my washing out on the drumsticks. It _was_ a bird. Oh,
dear, oh, dear! Well, I know when I threw the head out to the cat the
pore beast had convulsions in the backyard, and as for the parson’s
nose, well, as I said to my sister, the parson as had a nose like that
must have been a Jewish rabbit. What a set out it was, to be sure!
And my turkey which I ought to have had was sent up to a large family
gathering in the Shooter’s Hill Road, and half the party never tasted
turkey at all that Christmas.”

Mrs. Pottage continued in a strain of jovial reminiscence until her
lodgers had finished supper, after which she wanted to accompany them
upstairs to their room that she might help in the filling of Letizia’s
stocking.

“The fact is,” she whispered hoarsely, “I put that stocking of mine
out, because I’d bought a few odds and ends for her myself.”

She dived into the pockets of her voluminous skirt. “Here we are,
a bouncing dog with a chube at the end of it to squeeze. She can’t
swallow it unless she swallows the dog too, and I don’t think she’ll
do that. The _Story of the Three Bears_, warranted untearable, which
it isn’t, for I tore up two in the shop with my own hands just to show
the young man he didn’t know what he was talking about. A toy violing.
She won’t be able to play on it, but the varnish won’t hurt her. A
drum—well, it was really that drum which decided me to use one of my
own stockings. My calves have grown whopping. In fact, I’ve often said
jokingly to Mrs. Bugbird that I ought to call them cows nowadays.
That’s the lot, I think. Well, I shan’t wake you in the morning till
you ring. Just one tinkle will be enough. There’s no need to turn it
round as if you was playing a barrel organ, which is what the fellow
who played the villain in _His Life for Her_ did last November. He
wound up all the wire somewhere inside the wall. A nice set out we had,
and then he grumbled because I charged him in the bill for the work
the plumber did to get it right again. Well, good night, and a merry
Christmas.”

When the sound of Mrs. Pottage’s hoarse whispering had departed, the
little candlelit room glowed in the solemn hush of the great white
world, of which it seemed to be the warm and beating heart. Mother
and father bent low over the cot and listened to the faint breathing
of Letizia, watching lovingly those dark tangled curls and red-rose
cheeks. The father bent lower to touch them with his lips.

“No, no, don’t kiss her, boy,” said the mother. “You might wake her,
and she’ll be having such an exciting day to-morrow.”

Nancy blew out the candle on the table by the bed, and slipped her
silver key beneath Bram’s pillow. A shaft of moonlight pierced the
drawn curtains and struck the canopy of Letizia’s cot. The radiance
vanished as gathering snow-clouds obscured the face of the moon.
Nancy fell asleep to the sound of Bram’s watch carrying on a fairy
conversation amid the echoes of Mrs. Pottage’s absurd stories.




                              CHAPTER IX

                           A MERRY CHRISTMAS


The snowy air had painted the ceiling of the room a lurid grey when
Letizia woke her father and mother next morning. She was standing up in
her cot, holding the footrails of the big bed with one hand and waving
the toy dog in the other.

“Look, muvver, look at my dog? I’ve got a dog, muvver! Look, faver,
I’ve got a dog! Look, I say! Look, look!”

Her parents had just focussed their sleepy eyes on the dog when it was
flung on the floor, and the monkey was being waved in its place.

“Look, muvver, I’ve got a monkey! And he’s climbing up and down. Look,
faver, look at my monkey. Oh, do look!”

The monkey’s triumph was brief, his degradation swift. The fickle mob
had found another favourite.

“Oh, muvver, look at my baa-lamb. I’ve got a little baa-lamb, faver.
Look at my pretty little woolly baa-lamb, faver,” she shouted
imperiously.

But the lamb immediately followed his colleagues to the floor.

“And I’ve got a rub-a-dub-dub and a wheedle-wheedle and an apple and
an orange. And I saw Santy Claus come down the chiminy, and had a most
anormous beard you ever saw and he said, ‘How d’ye do, Tizia, will you
give me a nice kiss?’ And I said, ‘Yes,’ and he gived me a kiss, and he
put fousands and fousands of lovely fings into my stocking. Wasn’t Mrs.
Porridge kind to give me her stocking because it was so anormous? And
please can I come and get into bed with you and bring my trumpet?”

“Come along, darling,” invited Nancy, holding out her arms.

Letizia climbed very cautiously out of her cot and was lifted up on the
bed and deposited between her father and mother, where she sat and blew
her trumpet without a stop until her father picked up his pillow and
pretended to smother her.

“Hullo,” Bram exclaimed, looking at the little box which was thus
uncovered. “Here’s something of mother’s under father’s pillow.”

Nancy smiled and shook her head.

“No, boy, that’s yours.”

Bram smiled and shook his head.

“No, it’s yours. I put it under your pillow last night.”

“But, Bram, I put it under yours.”

By this time Letizia had disentangled herself from the pillow and was
sounding another tucket, so that she had to be smothered all over again
with Nancy’s pillow. And there was revealed another little box exactly
like the first.

“Open it, muvver. Oh, do open it!” Letizia urged. “Perhaps there’s
choc-chocs inside.”

“Strange,” Bram exclaimed. “What’s inside mine, I wonder?”

Nancy and he opened the two boxes. In each one was a silver key.

“Bram!”

“Nancy!”

“_This is the key of my heart. Keep it always, my darling_,” he read in
an awed voice.

“_With this key you unlocked my heart_,” she read in equal awe.

They wished each other a merry Christmas, and with their eyes they
vowed eternal love, those unlocked hearts too full for words, while
Letizia blew such a resounding alarum on her trumpet that she fetched
up Mrs. Pottage.

“Well now, fancy that! I heard her right downstairs in the kitchen.
Well, it’s real Christmas weather, and no mistake. Good morning, my
beauty, and how are you?”

This to Letizia.

“Mrs. Porridge, Santy Claus brought me a dog and a lamb and a monkey
and a rub-a-dub-dub and a wheedle-wheedle and a trumpet and a book and
an orange and an apple and some sweeties and fousands of fings. And he
came down the chiminy, and I wasn’t a bit frightened.”

Mrs. Pottage shook her head in delighted admiration.

“Did he come down head first or feet first?”

“Bofe,” Letizia declared, after a moment’s pause.

“You can’t catch her out, can you? Why, she’s as cunning as King
Pharaoh,” Mrs. Pottage chuckled, and with this she departed to fetch
the morning tea.

Nancy was suddenly seized with a desire to go to Mass and take Letizia.

“I’ll come too,” Bram volunteered. “Now, don’t discourage me.”

It was true that Nancy always was inclined to discourage him from
taking an interest in her religion. Not that she took such a very
profound interest in it herself, to tell the truth. But she had a
dread of people’s saying that she had forced her husband to become a
Catholic. He did at intervals bring up the subject of being received;
but there never seemed to be time to take any steps in the matter when
they were on tour, and when they were resting it seemed a pity to
worry their heads about religion. However, that morning Nancy did not
discourage Bram from accompanying her and Letizia to Mass.

Letizia was very full of her visit to the Crib, when she saw Mrs.
Pottage again.

“And I saw the baby Jesus in his nightygown, Mrs. Porridge.”

“You did?”

“Yes, and He was lying on His back and kicking His legs up in the air
ever so high. And there was a moo-cow smelling Him.”

“No, darling,” her mother interrupted, “the moo-cow was praying to Him.”

“Well, he was smelling Him too.”

“You’d have to start walking the week before last to get in front of
her,” said Mrs. Pottage.

There was a letter from Nancy’s father to greet with seasonable wishes,
her and hers, and as a kind of Christmas present there was an extra
flourish to his already florid signature. He had been engaged to
play Sir Lucius O’Trigger in a production of _The Rivals_ at a West
End theatre, and he felt sure that this meant finally abandoning the
provinces for London. There was, too, a letter from old Mrs. Fuller
written by her companion.

                                                     Lebanon House
                                                        Brigham.
                                                    Dec. 23rd, 1894.

  Dear Bram,

  I can no longer hold a pen, even to wish you a merry Christmas and
  a fortunate New Year, and as much to your Nancy and that unhappily
  named Letizia. Although I am indecently old—eighty-two—I ought still
  to be able to write, but I’ve had a slight stroke and I who  once
  died to live now only live to die.

                                  Your loving
                                           Grandmother.

Besides these two letters there were a few cards from friends, but not
many, for it is difficult to keep up with people’s whereabouts on tour.

The Christmas dinner was entirely a small family affair, but only the
more intensely enjoyed for that very reason. Mrs. Pottage was invited
in to dessert, and also Mrs. Pottage’s assistant, a crippled girl, who
was imported to help in the household work on occasions of ceremony.
Quite what help Agatha Wilkinson was no one ever discovered, for she
could only move with extreme slowness and difficulty on a pair of
crutches. Perhaps her utility lay in being able to sit quietly in a
corner of the kitchen and listen to Mrs. Pottage’s conversation, which
increased in volubility, the more she had to do. There was a pineapple
on the table, a slice of which the landlady emphatically declined.

“No, thanks, not for me. That’s a thing I only eat from the tin. Raw,
I’d sooner eat a pinecomb any day. Would you like to try a slice,
Aggie?”

Agatha was too shy to refuse when Bram put a slice on her plate, and
Mrs. Pottage watched with obvious gratification her fearful attempts to
manipulate it.

“Ah, I thought she wouldn’t like it. You needn’t eat any more, Aggie,
if it puts your teeth on the edge. Yes, it’s my opinion if pineapples
cost twopence apiece instead of ten shillings people might buy a few
just to throw at strange cats. To scrape your boots on? Yes. To eat?
No. That’s my opinion about pineapples.”

In the evening, when Letizia had been put to bed after a number of
uproarious games in which Bram had surpassed even his own wonderful
record as an animal impersonator, Mrs. Pottage came in as magnificent
as a queen-dowager in black satin to ask if her lodgers would give her
the pleasure of their company in the parlour.

“I’ve got a few friends coming in to celebrate Christmas. Mrs.
Bugbird’s here, and two of my unintendeds—Mr. Hopkins, the
chandler—well, I thought I’d ask him, though he’s no more addition to
anything than a nought, which is what he looks like—and then there’s
Mr. Watcher. Yes, Watcher’s a good name for him, for he watches me
like a dog watches a bone. He and Mr. Hopkins can’t bear the sight of
one another. Well, I daresay there’s a bit of jealousy in it, if it
comes to that, just because I happened to refuse him before I refused
Hopkins. His business is coal. Sells it, I mean. I don’t think even
Watcher would have had the nerve to propose to me if he’d have actually
been a coalman. Oh, dear, oh, dear, who does marry coalmen, that’s what
I ask myself. Or sweeps, if it comes to that? And then there’s Mr. and
Mrs. Breadcutt, who’s an inspector of nuisances for the London County
Council. So, if you’ll come in and join us, we shall be a very nice
merry little party.”

Though they were feeling rather tired, Bram and Nancy accepted the
invitation, because Mrs. Pottage had been so kind to them and they
knew she would be terribly disappointed if they refused. However, they
stipulated that she must not persuade them to stay very late on account
of the matinée, to which, they reminded her, she had promised to take
Letizia to-morrow.

“Oh, I hadn’t forgotten. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy a good pantomime.
It’s a pity Mrs. Bugbird’s got to go and see her relations over in
Putney, because that woman so loves a bit of fun and always laughs so
hearty that she’d make any panto a success just by being there.”

Mrs. Bugbird, who was in the parlour when Bram and Nancy walked
downstairs, was built on an altogether larger scale than Mrs. Pottage.
The latter was plump and for her age still remarkably buxom; but she
was not noticeably too fat. On the other hand, Mrs. Bugbird’s immense
face crowned a really massive campanulate base. When she laughed,
which was practically all the time, her little eyes kept bubbling up
out of her cheeks and then apparently bursting as they were once more
swallowed up by the rolls of fat. This likeness to bursting bubbles was
accentuated by the drops of moisture that during her spasms of mirth
kept trickling down Mrs. Bugbird’s cheeks, so that she had from time to
time to wipe them away with an extensive red silk handkerchief on which
was printed in bright yellow a view of the Pool of London.

A feature of Mrs. Pottage’s best parlour was one of those Victorian
triple chairs, two of which were occupied by Mr. Hopkins and Mr.
Watcher. This meant that they were practically sitting back to back, an
attitude which did nothing to allay the rumour of their mutual lack of
esteem. Sitting thus, with their polished bald heads, they looked like
two boiled eggs in a china stand. No doubt, Mrs. Bugbird had perceived
this ridiculous resemblance, for every time she threw a glance in
the direction of the two rivals her eyes bubbled in and out with the
rapidity of soda-water. The outward appearance of Mr. Breadcutt, the
inspector of nuisances, bore no signs of his profession; indeed he
looked as tolerant and as genial a man as one might expect to meet in
a month. Perhaps the nuisances were ferreted out by Mrs. Breadcutt, an
angular woman with a pair of intelligent, pink-rimmed eyes, who sat up
on the edge of her chair like an attentive bull-terrier. The party was
completed by Agatha Wilkinson.

“Well, now we’re all here, what game shall we play?” Mrs. Pottage asked
expansively.

“Kiss in the ring,” Mr. Breadcutt suggested without a moment’s
hesitation. Whereupon Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Watcher both scowled, the
one at the ceiling, the other at the floor, while Mrs. Bugbird rocked
backward and forward in a convulsion of irrepressible mirth.

“George,” said Mrs. Breadcutt sharply.

“Yes, my dear?”

“Behave yourself, even if it is Christmas. You ought to know better at
your age than suggest such a game in a little room like this.”

“That’s just why I did suggest it,” Mr. Breadcutt retorted. “I’d have a
chance of catching Mrs. Pottage and helping myself to a good one.”

Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Watcher turned simultaneously at this outrageous
admission to glare at the inspector of nuisances. Unfortunately Mr.
Hopkins turned his head to the left and Mr. Watcher turned his head
to the right, so that their eyes met, and instead of glaring at Mr.
Breadcutt they glared at each other.

“Well, I’m going to call on Mr. Fuller for a song,” said Mrs. Pottage.
She apologised later for thus dragging him into a performance on his
night off. “But really,” she said, “I thought Hopkins and Watcher
was going to fly at one another. They looked like a couple of boxing
kangaroos.”

Bram obliged the flattered company with two or three songs which Nancy
accompanied on the ancient piano, the noise of which was the occasion
of another apology by the hostess.

“More like teeth clicking than music, isn’t it? Well, it hasn’t really
been used since the year dot excepting for a bookcase. It belonged to
my dear old dad, and he only bought it to cover up a spot in the wall
where the roof leaked. He couldn’t bear music, the dear old man. When
he was over seventy, he nearly got fined for squirting a syringe full
of the stuff he washed his greenhouse with into the big end of a cornet
and which a blind man was playing outside his house. Of course, as he
explained, he wasn’t to know the pore fellow was blind or he’d have
spoke before he spouted. But _I’m_ very fond of music, I am.”

And to prove her sincerity Mrs. Pottage sang _Two Lovely Black Eyes_, a
performance which so utterly convulsed Mrs. Bugbird that she fell off
her chair, and sat undulating on the floor for nearly five minutes,
until the united efforts of the male guests got her back again, when
in order to deal with the moisture induced by such excess of mirth,
she had to produce her reserve handkerchief, on which was printed a
gruesome picture of the execution of Mr. and Mrs. Manning.

Then Nancy sang to Bram’s accompaniment, after which Bram gave
imitations of familiar animals to the intense pleasure of Mr.
Breadcutt, who slapped his leg and declared he was a blooming marvel.

“George!” snapped his wife.

“Yes, my dear?”

“Don’t swear!”

“Blooming isn’t swearing.”

“It’s as near as not to be worth an argument,” she said severely.

This caused Mr. Breadcutt to wink at Mr. Watcher, who thought he was
winking at Mrs. Pottage and did not respond.

Then Mr. Hopkins tried to remember for the benefit of the company what
he assured everybody was a capital game that he often used to play at
social gatherings twenty years ago.

“We all sit round in a circle,” he began in a doleful voice. “Wait a
minute, what do you do next? Oh, yes,” he went on, as soon as he was
sure that Mr. Watcher had been successfully isolated from Mrs. Pottage.
“Now we all join hands.” Perhaps the emotion of finding her plump
hand firmly imprisoned in his own was too much for the ship-chandler,
for he could not remember what was the next move. “Wait a minute,” he
implored, holding Mrs. Pottage’s hand tighter than ever. “Don’t move,
and I’ll remember in a jiffy. Oh, yes, I’ve got it! I knew I would!
Somebody has to be in the middle of the circle. Mr. Watcher, perhaps
you’d stand in the middle, will you?”

“Hadn’t you better stand in the middle yourself?” the coal-merchant
replied. “You thought of this game. We aren’t guilty.”

“Don’t be so gruff, Watcher,” said Mrs. Pottage sternly. “You’ve been
sitting like a skelington at the feast ever since you arrived. Wake up
and be a man, do.”

Thus adjured Mr. Watcher unwillingly stood up in the middle of the
circle.

“What’s he do now, Hopkins?” Mrs. Pottage asked.

“I’m trying to remember. Oh, yes, of course, I know. I know. I know!
He’s blindfolded,” Mr. Hopkins exclaimed in a tone as near to being
cock-a-whoop as his low-pitched funereal voice could achieve.

“Mrs. B., you’ve got a nice big handkerchief. Tie Watcher up, there’s a
good soul,” the hostess ordered.

Mrs. Bugbird in a gurgle of suppressed laughter muffled the
coal-merchant’s disagreeable countenance with her reserve handkerchief,
from which his bald head emerged like one of those costly Easter eggs
that repose on silk in the centre of confectioners’ shops.

“Now what does he do, Hopkins?”

“Just a minute, Mrs. Pottage. I’m stuck again. No, I’m not. I remember
perfectly now. Turn him round three times.”

This was done, and there was another pause.

“Well, what next?” everybody asked impatiently.

“That’s just what I’m bothered if I can remember,” said the chandler at
last. “It’s on the tip of my tongue too ... but wait ... yes, no ...
yes, I’ve got it ... he asks ... no, that’s wrong, _he_ doesn’t ask
anything, we ask _him_.... Now what the juice is it we do ask him?...
Don’t say anything, because I’ll remember in a minute.... I’m bound to
remember.... You see, it’s such a long time since I played this game
that some of the rules....”

“Look here,” Mr. Watcher’s irate voice growled through the folds of the
handkerchief, “if you think I’m going to stand here wrapped up like a
Stilton cheese while you remember what game you played with Nore in the
Ark, you’re blooming well mistaken. And that’s that.”

“If you’d only have a morsel of patience, Mr. Watcher. I can’t remember
the whole of a big game all at once,” protested the chandler, still
clinging desperately to Mrs. Pottage’s hand. “But I will remember it.
It’s on the tip of my tongue, I tell you.”

“Well, what’s on the tip of my tongue to tell you,” shouted Mr.
Watcher, “I wouldn’t like to tell anybody, not in front of ladies.”
With which he pulled down the handkerchief round his neck and stood
glaring at the other players with the expression of a fierce cowboy.

Mr. Breadcutt in order to quiet the coal-merchant proposed as a game
familiar to everybody blind man’s buff.

“Not me you don’t blindfold again,” said Mr. Watcher. “And if Mr.
Hopkins starts in to try I’ll blindfold him without a handkerchief.”

“Well, what about a snack of supper?” suggested the hostess, who felt
that the situation required a diversion.

And her supper was such a success that before it was over the two
rivals were confiding in each other various ways of getting the better
of their common enemy, the purchaser.

When it was time to adjourn again to the parlour, Bram and Nancy begged
to be excused from enjoying themselves any longer in Mrs. Pottage’s
company in view of the hard day before them at the Theatre Royal.

“You’ve given us such a jolly Christmas, dear Mrs. Pottage,” said Bram.

“A lovely Christmas,” Nancy echoed.

“Well, I’m sure I’ve enjoyed _my_self, and Mrs. Bugbird said she’s
never laughed so much in all her life as what she did when Mr. Fuller
was imitating them animals. ‘Lifelike,’ she said they was, and she
spent her girlhood on a farm, so that’s a bit of a compliment coming
from her. Well, good night. Oh, dear, oh, dear, before we know where we
are we shall be seeing in the New Year. I’m bound to say, what with one
thing and another life’s full of fun.”




                               CHAPTER X

                             THE PANTOMIME


“Now listen, Letizia, you’re to be a very good little girl and do
anything that Mrs. Pottage tells you without arguing,” Nancy admonished
her small daughter before she left Starboard Alley next morning to
dress for the matinée.

“Can I take my lamb what Santy Claus gave me to the pantomine?”

“Yes, I daresay Mrs. Pottage will let you.”

“And my dog? And my monkey? And my rub-a-dub-dub and my wheedle-wheedle
and my....”

“No, darling, you can take the lamb, but the others must stay at home.”

“I aspeck they’ll cry,” Letizia prophesied solemnly. “Because they
guessed they was going to the pantomine.”

“If she isn’t a regular masterpiece,” the landlady exclaimed. “Oh,
dear, oh, dear! She’s got an answer for every blessed thing. Listen, my
beauty, we’ll leave the rest of the menargerie to keep John company.”

John was the canary, and fortunately this solution commended itself to
Letizia, who seemed more hopeful for the happiness of the toys that
were going to be left behind.

There is no doubt that the presence of Mrs. Pottage and Letizia
contributed largely to the success of the Theatre Royal pantomime that
afternoon. No false shame deterred Letizia from making it quite clear
to the audience that it was her own mother who bearded the Demon King
Rat in his sulphurous abode.

    “Stop, ere you any viler magic potions brew,
    For I declare such wickedness you soon shall rue.”

“Muvver!” cried Letizia, clapping her hands in an ecstasy of welcome.

“Ush!” said a solemn and deeply interested woman sitting in the row
behind.

“It _is_ my muvver, I tell you,” said Letizia, standing up on the seat
of the stall and turning round indignantly to address the woman over
the back of it.

“Of course, it’s her mother,” Mrs. Pottage joined in even more
indignantly. “Nice thing if a child can’t call out ‘mother’ in a free
country without being hushed as if she was nobody’s child.”

The solemn woman took an orange out of a bag and sucked it in silent
disapproval.

    “No use for you to raise the least objection,
    Dick Whittington is under my protection,”

declared the Fairy Queen, waving her wand to the accompaniment of a
white spot-light.

    “In vain you seek to make my plans miscarry,
    For Dick his master’s daughter shall not marry,”

declared the Demon King Rat, waving his sceptre to the accompaniment of
a red spot-light.

“That man’s bad,” Letizia announced gravely.

If the traditional scene of alternate defiance of each other by the
powers of Good and Evil had lasted much longer, she might have made
an attempt to reach the stage and fight at her mother’s side; but the
Demon King Rat vanished down a trap and the Fairy Queen hurried off
Left to make way for Cheapside.

“Why has faver got a red nose?” Letizia inquired, when Bram entered
made up for Idle Jack. “I don’t like him to have a red nose. My lamb
what Santy Claus gave me doesn’t like him to have a red nose.”

Whereupon Letizia climbed up on the seat of the stall once more and
turned her back on the stage in disgust.

“Would you mind telling your little girl to kindly sit down,” the
solemn and deeply interested woman behind requested of Mrs. Pottage.

“This is my lamb what Santy Claus gave me,” Letizia informed the solemn
woman in her most engaging voice, at which the solemn woman turned
to her neighbour and declared angrily that children oughtn’t to be
allowed into pantomimes if they couldn’t behave theirselves a bit more
civilised.

“Get down, duckie, there’s a love,” said Mrs. Pottage, who in spite of
her contempt for the solemn woman could not but feel that she had some
reason to complain.

“Well, I don’t want to see faver with that red nose,” objected Letizia,
who thereupon sat down in her stall, but held her hands in front of
her eyes to shut out the unpleasant aspect of her father in his comic
disguise. However, Idle Jack did so many funny things that at last his
daughter’s heart was won, so that presently she and Mrs. Pottage were
leading the laughter of the house.

Finally when Idle Jack emptied a bag of flour on the Dame, Letizia was
seized by such a rapture of appreciation that she flung her lamb into
the orchestra and hit the first violin on the head.

“Faver,” she shouted. “I’ve frowed my lamb what Santy Claus gave me,
and the wheedle-wheedle in the band has tooked him somewhere.”

Bram came down to the footlights and shook his fist at his small
daughter, an intimate touch that drove the house frantic with delight
and caused the solemn woman to observe to her neighbour that she didn’t
know who did come to the theatre nowadays, such a common lot of people
as they always seemed to be.

One of the features of pantomimes about this period was the
introduction of a sentimental song, usually allotted to the Fairy Queen
as having some pretensions to a voice, in the course of which a boy of
about twelve, chosen no doubt from the local church or chapel choir,
rose from his seat in the front row of the circle and answered the
singer on the stage, to the extreme delectation of the audience.

The refrain of the song this year went:

    Sweet Suzanne,
    I’ll be your young man,
    They’ve never made your equal
    Since the world began.
    Won’t you take my name?
    For my heart’s aflame
    For love of you,
    My pretty Sue,
    My sweet Suzanne.

and again:

    Your lips are red as rubies,
    Your eyes are diamonds rare,
    So while I have you,
    My lovely Sue,
    I’m as rich as a millionaire.

Why the Fairy Queen should suddenly enter and break into this
drivelling song was an unanswerable enigma, and why a little boy in an
Eton suit with a very white collar and a very pink face should rise
from the front row of the circle and sing each verse over again, while
the Fairy Queen walked backward and forward with one hand held to her
apparently entranced ear, was an equally unanswerable enigma.

At any rate Letizia thoroughly disapproved of the anomaly. While all
the women in the pit and gallery and stalls and circle were exclaiming:

“Oh, isn’t he a little love? Well, I declare, if he isn’t reelly
lovely. Oh, do listen to the little angel,” Letizia was frowning.
Then with great deliberation, unobserved by Mrs. Pottage, who was
languishing upon the sibilant cockney of this detestable young treble,
she stood up on the seat and shouted:

“Muvver!”

The Fairy Queen, while still holding one hand to an entranced ear,
shook her wand at her little mortal daughter. But Letizia was not to be
deterred from the problem that was puzzling her sense of fitness.

“Muvver!” she shouted again. “_Why_ is that boy?”

Then Mrs. Pottage woke from the trance into which the duet had flung
her and pulled Letizia down again into a sitting posture.

“Duckie, you mustn’t call out and spoil the lovely singing.”

“I don’t like that boy,” said Letizia firmly.

“Yes, but listen.”

“And my lamb what Santy Claus gave me doesn’t like him.”

“Hush, duckie, hush!”

“And I won’t listen. And I won’t look, Mrs. Porridge.”

“Come, come, be a good girl.”

But Letizia struggled out of Mrs. Pottage’s arms and retreated under
the seat of the stall from which she did not emerge until this
enigmatic interlude in the life of the Fairy Queen came to an end amid
a tumult of applause from the profoundly moved audience.

Letizia failed to recognise her father when he came rushing on for
the Harlequinade at the end of the Transformation Scene with the
time-honoured greeting of “Here we are again!” And when Mrs. Pottage
told her who the clown was, she merely shook her head violently and
reiterated “No, no, no, no, no!”

However, the Harlequinade itself thoroughly amused her, although she
did not approve of the Harlequin’s dance with her mother the Columbine.

“Who is that spotted man?” she asked. “Why does he frow muvver up like
that? I don’t like him. I don’t like his black face. I won’t let him
frow up my lamb what Santy Claus gave me.”

“Well, you threw it up yourself just now and hit the poor fiddle.”

“Yes,” Letizia acknowledged in a tone of plump contentment.

The Harlequinade came to an end with a wonderful trap-act, in which the
Clown was pursued by the Policeman head first through one shop window,
head first out through another, up a long flight of stairs that turned
into planks just as they both reached the top, so that they both rolled
down to the bottom and disappeared into a cellar. Out again and diving
through more windows, whirling round doors without hinges, climbing
over roofs, sliding down chimneys, until at last the Policeman’s
pursuit was shaken off and the Clown, after bounding up ten feet into
the air through a star-trap, alighted safely on the stage whence, after
snatching a basket that was hanging up outside a shop window, he began
to pelt the audience with crackers while the orchestra stood up to
play _God Save the Queen_ and the curtain slowly descended on a great
success at the Theatre Royal, Greenwich.




                              CHAPTER XI

                      THE END OF THE HARLEQUINADE


“I don’t think you _were_ a very good little girl,” said Nancy
reproachfully to her daughter when she was brought round to the
dressing-room by Mrs. Pottage after the matinée.

“Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,” averred Letizia entirely impenitent. “My
lamb what Santy Claus gave me saided I was a very good little girl. He
saided ‘Oh, Tizia, you _is_ a good little girl!’”

The landlady beamed.

“There’s one thing, she thoroughly enjoyed her little self, and so did
I, I’m bound to say, even if we _was_ a bit noisy.”

“I’m afraid Letizia was very noisy indeed.”

“Yes, but nobody minded two penn’orth of gin except a dismal-faced
widow-woman sitting just behind us, and she’d had more than two
penn’orth before ever she come out which is my opinion.”

“My husband and I won’t have time to dress and come home between the
shows,” said Nancy. “We’re having some dinner sent in to us here. The
curtain goes up again at seven, and it’s nearly six now.”

There was a tap on the door, and Bram, still in his clown’s dress but
without the tufted wig, peeped round the corner.

“Well, you’re a nice one,” he said to his daughter. “I nearly sent the
policeman down to you.”

“_Was_ you that white man with a funny face?” Letizia asked
incredulously.

“There you are, I told you it was your dadda,” Mrs. Pottage put in.

“Yes,” said Letizia, and in the tone of the affirmation a desire
to admit frankly that she had been wrong was mingled with a slight
resentment that Mrs. Pottage should have been right.

When Letizia had departed with the landlady, Bram and Nancy joined
several other members of the company at a picnic meal. The talk was
mostly of the pantomime, of how this song had gone and how that joke
had got across, of whether it would not be wiser to cut this scene out
altogether and shorten that one.

“Of course it’ll play closer to-night,” said one of the company. “And
they’ll be a little quicker with the changes. Or it’s to be hoped they
will.”

“That limelight man is a bit of a jay,” said the Demon King gloomily.
“Would he follow me with that spot? Not he. And when I was singing my
song, the fool was jigging it all over the stage like a damned rocket.
His mate was better with you, Miss O’Finn.”

“He was on me all right,” Nancy allowed. “But he ruined the last verse
of my first song by letting it fizz till I could have knocked him off
his perch with my wand.”

“I think our trap-act went great, old boy,” said the Policeman to the
Clown. “I’ve never known a trap-act go so smooth the first time. The
house was eating it.”

Bram nodded.

“Yes, it went all right,” he admitted without enthusiasm. “But that
star didn’t seem to me to be working properly again. Which reminds me,
I must get hold of Worsley and tell him to have a look at it.”

“Who wants Worsley?” inquired the stage-manager, coming into the
dressing-room at that moment.

“It was about that star-trap, old man,” said Bram.

“Now, that’s all right, old chap. Don’t you worry. I’ve been down under
the stage, and it’s working to rights now. Lovely.”

“I thought I wasn’t coming through this afternoon,” Bram grumbled.

“Why, you came up like a bird,” Worsley assured him. “What are you
talking about?”

“Yes, I know I _did_ come up,” Bram replied irritably, for he was
feeling thoroughly tired. “But it did stick for a second or two, and
you know what it would mean if I got caught.”

“Oh, Mr. Worsley,” Nancy exclaimed in a panic, “for God’s sake see it’s
all right to-night.”

“Now, don’t you worry yourself, Miss O’Finn,” the stage-manager begged.
“Good Lord, you don’t suppose _I_ want to have an accident?”

“I wish you’d speak to that blasted limelight man about getting his
red spot on me,” said the Demon King. “He ruined every entrance I’ve
got—and I haven’t got too many.”

The stage-manager decided that he should be happier elsewhere, and left
the assembled diners.

“Have a drink, old man,” somebody called after him. But Mr. Worsley
suspected a _quid pro quo_ and shouted back:

“Haven’t time now, old man. I’ll join you after the evening show. I’ve
got to see the property man.”

And they heard his voice go shouting along the corridors.

“Props! Props! Where the deuce is Props?”

“Poor old Mangel Worsley,” said the Demon King, with a gloomy shake of
the head. “He never ought to have gone in for panto. He’s not up to it.
He’d have done better to stick to Shakespeare. I saw his production of
_Macbeth_ for Wilson Forbes. Very pretty little show it was, too. Very
pretty. But this sort of thing is too big for him altogether. He can’t
grasp the detail. Result? My entrances go for nothing. For absolutely
nothing! It stands to reason, if a red spot-light’s thrown Right Centre
when I come on Down Stage Left it kills me dead. But that doesn’t
trouble Worsley, because he doesn’t realise the importance of ensemble.
He niggles, and it’s a pity, because within limits he’s quite a good
stage-manager.”

How full the Theatre Royal was that Boxing Night! And Morton’s Theatre,
the rival house, was just as full. People went to the pantomime
even in days as near to us as the early nineties. They could not
amuse themselves then by sporting with Amaryllis in the shade of a
picture-palace while black-eyed heroes dreamed in profile during two
hours of a monotonous reel or black-lipped heroines smeared their
cheeks with vaseline and, intolerably magnified, blubbered silently at
an unresponsive audience. The audience of the Theatre Royal that night
was there to enjoy the performance, even though it lasted from seven
o’clock till midnight. People went to the theatre in those days to see
and to hear, to love and to hate. They were not sitting jam-packed in
that reek of oranges and dust for the sake of cuddling one another.
Nobody dressed up like a fireman came and squirted antiseptic perfumes
over them. The odor of its own wedged-in humanity was grateful, an
entity that breathed, cheered, laughed, and wept as one. The Grand,
Islington, the Britannia, Hoxton, the Standard, Shoreditch, the
transpontine Surrey, yes, and in those days Old Drury itself still
defiant of change—all these theatres held people, not fidgety shadows
gazing with lack-lustre eyes at a representation of fidgety shadows.

In spite of their fatigue the company played _Dick Whittington_ that
night at Greenwich with treble the vigour of the afternoon performance.
Everything went better, in spite of the absence of Mrs. Pottage and
Letizia. Even the limelight men managed to keep their beams steadily
fixed on the object of their enhancement whencesoever he might enter,
whithersoever he might move, wheresoever he might stand. The billows
of the Demon King’s bass rolled along twice as majestically. Nancy’s
song with the overwashed chorister in the circle earned a double
encore. Principal boy, principal girl, dame, knockabout comedians, all
gained the good-will of the house. But _the_ success was Bram. After
his first scene Idle Jack had only to appear on the stage to send the
audience into a roar. The tritest line of dialogue was received as
heavenly wit. The stalest piece of fooling was welcomed in a rapture.

“Darling, you are being so funny to-night,” Nancy told him, when for a
moment they found themselves side by side in the wings.

“I don’t feel at all funny,” Bram said. “In fact, it’s because I’m
feeling so tired and depressed off, I suppose, that I’m trying to cheer
up by being extra funny on.”

He squeezed her hand, and a moment later she heard the deep-voiced
laughter of the house greeting another of his entrances.

Bram’s success as Idle Jack that night was consolidated by his Joey.
He was not just the traditional clown with wide red mouth, bending
low in exaggerated laughter and treading always on hot bricks. There
was something of the Pierrot in his performance. Not that he scorned
tradition overmuch. The whole audience recognised him as the authentic
Joey of their imagination; but he did contrive to be somehow the
incarnate spirit of that London street much more essentially than the
heavy-footed Harlequin, much more essentially than Columbine, whose
short pink tarlatan skirt did not become Nancy’s height, though she
pirouetted on and off the stage gracefully enough. Pantaloon, too,
was good, and the actor did manage to represent that hoary-headed
ancient Londoner in his absurd Venetian disguise. But Bram was the
ghost of old London itself—a London that was fast dying, though here in
Greenwich it might seem to be as full of vitality as ever. It was the
London of sweet lavender and cherry ripe, the London of hot cockles,
of Punch and Judy shows and four-wheelers and lumbering knife-board
omnibuses, of gas-lamps and queer beggars. Bram’s incarnation of this
vanishing city had that authentic whimsicality (the very term is nearly
unintelligible now) of old cockney humour, an urban Puckishness as if
for a while Robin Goodfellow had tried to keep pace with the times and
live in great cities. He made his audience feel that sausages were only
strung together because it was more amusing to steal a string than a
single sausage. His red-hot poker itself glowed with such a geniality
of warmth as made the audience feel that everybody to whose seat it
was applied was being slapped on the back in the spirit of the purest
good-fellowship.

Nancy had flitted for the last time across that most fantastic yet so
utterly ordinary street; and she paused in the wings for a moment,
before going up to her dressing-room, to listen to the tumultuous
laughter of the house at the great trap-act which was the climax of
the Harlequinade. She saw Bram’s white figure come diving through the
shop window and safely caught by the scene-hands stationed on the other
side. She saw the Policeman follow close upon his heels, and watched
the pair of them chase each other round and round the revolving door.
She heard the thunders of applause as the trick staircase shot the
protagonists from top to bottom, and the still louder thunder when Bram
appeared among the chimney-pots. Then she turned away and had just
reached the door of her dressing-room when the corridors which had been
echoing with the distant applause became suddenly still as death.

“I hope that husband of mine’s not doing some particularly breakneck
feat to thrill the Bank Holiday crowd,” she said to the principal girl
with whom she shared a room and who was by now nearly dressed. “What
has happened?” Nancy repeated. This quiet was unnatural. A gust of
overwhelming dread sent her hurrying back down the corridor, as she
heard the agonised voice of Worsley crying:

“Ring down! Ring down! For the love of God, ring down!”

At the head of the stairs she met the Pantaloon, beardless, with
startled eyes, who waved her back.

“Don’t come down on the stage for a minute, Miss O’Finn. There’s been
an accident. He was caught in the star-trap. The spring must have
broken.”

“Bram....”

He nodded, and burst into tears.

Nancy hurried past him toward the stage. Beyond the dropped curtain she
could hear the murmur of the anxious and affrighted audience. Bram was
lying beside the closed trap, the pointed sections of which were red.

“There isn’t a doctor in the whole audience,” Worsley was saying. “But
several people have run to fetch one. How do you feel now, old man?”

Nancy pushed her way through the staring group, and knelt beside Bram,
now unconscious, a bloody belt round his white dress, his head pillowed
on the string of sausages.

“My precious one,” she cried. “Oh, my precious one!”

His eyelids flickered at her voice, and his limp body quivered very
faintly.

“A doctor will be here in a minute, Miss O’Finn,” Worsley said.

“A doctor,” she cried. “Damn you, damn you! A doctor! He told you the
trap wasn’t working properly. If he dies, it will be you that has
killed him.”

By now, several of the ladies of the company had joined the group round
the prostrate clown.

“Hush, dear,” said one of them, “don’t say anything you may regret
afterwards.”

Nancy did not answer this pacific woman, but bent low over her husband.

“My precious one, my precious one.”

The doctor came at last. When he had finished his examination, he shook
his head.

“He is injured mortally.”

“Dying?” Nancy whispered.

“He can hardly live many more minutes with these injuries. Has he any
relations here?”

“I am his wife.”

“My poor girl,” said the doctor quickly. “I didn’t realise that. But
I couldn’t have hidden the truth. He must lie here. He’s unconscious.
Even to move him to a dressing-room would probably kill him.”

The group round the dying man moved away and left him alone with his
wife and the doctor, on that silent bright unnatural stage.

“And is there nothing we can do?” she asked.

“Nothing, my poor girl. It is kinder to leave him unconscious and not
try to revive him. He will suffer less.”

But presently Bram’s lips moved, and Nancy bending low to his mouth
heard the dim voice speaking with a fearful effort.

“I’m dying—Nancy darling—I wish—I wish....”

The dim voice died away.

“Oh, my only love, my darling, what do you wish? Do you want to see
Letizia?”

“No—no—better not—not kind for baby girls to see death—better
not—better not—Mrs. Pottage very kind—kind and good—I wish—I wish....”

Again the dim voice was lost.

“What, my precious one? What do you wish?”

“Nancy—if things are difficult—we haven’t saved much money—difficult—go
to Caleb—too bitter about my people—too hard—faults on both
sides—Nancy, kiss me once—quick—quick—I don’t think I shall know soon
if you kiss me....”

She touched his cold lips with hers.

“Such a darling wife—always such a darling—very happy together—happy
memories—your father’s speech—yes, Caleb will look after you if things
very difficult—give my love to grandmamma—always kind to me—happy
memories—Nancy! Nancy! I wish—oh, my own Nancy, I do wish....”

The dim voice was lost in the great abyss of eternity that stretched
beyond this fantastic ordinary street, beyond this silent bright
unnatural stage.

“Sweetheart, what do you wish? What do you wish?”

But the Clown was dead.




                              CHAPTER XII

                           LOOKING FOR WORK


There was not much money left when the funeral expenses had been paid
and Nancy had bought her mourning—those poor black suits of woe that
in their utter inadequacy even to symbolise still less to express her
grief seemed like an insult to the beloved dead. It was a desperate
challenge to fortune to abandon the Greenwich engagement. But Nancy
could not bring herself to the point of returning to the cast of the
pantomime. That was beyond the compass of her emotional endurance.
The management offered her a larger salary to play the Fairy Queen
only, without appearing as Columbine; but she refused. The Employers’
Liability Act did not exist at this date; and when the management
suggested, as a reason for not paying her direct compensation, that the
accident had already cost them dearly enough in the gloom it had shed
over what promised to be a really successful production, Nancy’s grief
would not allow her even to comment on such a point of view. Bram was
dead. People told her that she had a good case against the theatre. But
Bram was dead. He was dead. He was dead. All she wanted was to leave
Greenwich for ever, and when Mrs. Pottage offered her hospitality she
refused.

“It’s not pride, dear Mrs. Pottage, that prevents my staying on with
you. You mustn’t think that. It’s simply that I could not bear to go
on living alone where he and I lived together. I’m sure to find an
engagement presently. I have enough money left to keep Letizia and
myself for quite a little time.”

“Well, don’t let’s lose sight of each other for good and all,” said
the landlady. “Let’s meet some day and go down to Margate together
and have a nice sea blow. I’ve got a friend down there—well, friend, I
say, though she’s a relation really, but she is a friend for all that,
a good friend—well, this Sarah Williams has a very natty little house
looking out on the front, and we could spend a nice time with her when
she’s not full up with lodgers. I’d say ‘come down now,’ but Margate in
January’s a bit like living in a house with the windows blown out and
the doors blown in and the roof blown off and the walls blown down.”

So, Nancy left Starboard Alley and went to live in rooms in Soho,
perhaps in the very same house where more than a century ago Letizia’s
great-great-grandmother had been left with that cageful of love-birds
and the twenty pairs of silk stockings.

The houses in Blackboy Passage were flat-faced, thin, and tall like the
houses in Hogarth’s “Night.” At one end an archway under the ancient
tavern that gave its name to the small and obscure thoroughfare led
into Greek Street. At the other end a row of inebriated posts forbade
traffic to vehicles from Frith Street. The houses had enjoyed a brief
modishness in the middle of the eighteenth century, but since then
their tenants had gradually declined in quality while at the same time
steadily increasing in quantity. By this date nearly every one of the
tall houses had a perpendicular line of bells beside its front door and
a ladder of outlandish names. The house in which Nancy found lodgings
was an exception, for all of it except the basement belonged to Miss
Fewkes, who was her landlady. Miss Fewkes was a dried-up little woman
of over fifty, with a long sharp nose, and raddled cheeks so clumsily
powdered as to give to her face the appearance of a sweet which has
lost its freshness and been dusted over with sugar. Incredible as it
now might seem, Miss Fewkes had had a past. She had actually been
in the Orient ballet once, and the mistress of several men, each of
whom was a step lower in the scale than his predecessor. From each of
these temporary supporters she had managed to extract various sums of
money, the total of which she had invested in furnishing this house
in Blackboy Passage, where for many years she had let lodgings to the
profession. In spite of her paint and powder and past, Miss Fewkes wore
an air of withered virginity, and appeared to possess little more human
nature than one of her own lace antimacassars. Her thin prehensile
fingers resembled the claws of a bird; her voice was as the sound of
dead leaves blown along city pavements. Letizia disliked Miss Fewkes as
much as she had liked Mrs. Pottage. Nor did Miss Fewkes like Letizia,
whose presence in her lodgings she resented in the same way that she
would have resented a pet dog’s.

“I noticed your little girl’s finger-marks on the bedroom-door this
morning. Two black marks. Of course, as I explained to you, Miss
O’Finn, I don’t really care to have children in my rooms, but if I do
take them in I rather expect that they won’t make finger-marks. It’s
difficult enough to keep things clean in London, as I’m sure you’ll
understand.”

Nancy would have left Miss Fewkes after a week if she had had to leave
Letizia in her charge while she hung about in the outer offices of
theatrical agents in Garrick Street and Maiden Lane. Fortunately,
however, there were staying in the same house a Mr. and Mrs. Kino,
who took a great fancy to Letizia and insisted on having as much of
her company as they could obtain. Mr. Kino was the proprietor and
trainer of a troup of performing elephants, which were then appearing
at Hengler’s Circus. Mrs. Kino, a large pink and yellow woman, had
domestic ambitions and a longing for children of her own. Possibly
her dependency on elephants had begotten in her a passion for
diminutiveness. At any rate, until Letizia won her heart, she spent
all her time in stringing beads for little purses. Even when she made
friends with Letizia, the toys she always preferred to buy for her
were minute china animals and Lilliputian dolls, for which she enjoyed
making quantities of tiny dresses.

“Too large, duckie, much too large,” was her comment when Letizia
showed her the cargo of her Christmas stocking.

Miss Fewkes sniffed when she saw the china animals.

“Silly things to give a child,” she said. “Next thing is she’ll be
swallowing them and have to be taken in a cab to the hospital, but,
then, some people in this world go about looking for trouble and, when
they get it, expect every one else to sympathise. Ugh! I’ve no patience
with them, I haven’t.”

Nancy had found it impossible to persuade Letizia that she would never
see her father again in this world.

“I aspeck he’s only wented away,” she insisted. “I aspeck he’ll come
back down the chiminy one night. My lamb what Santy Claus gave me
saided he was perfickatally sure faver would come back down the chiminy
one night. So, I fink we’d better leave the gas burning, don’t you,
because he wouldn’t like to come back all in the dark, would he?”

Mrs. Kino was in the room when Letizia put forward this theory and with
a dumpy hand she silently patted the black sleeve of Nancy, who had
turned away to hide the tears.

Perhaps the kindest thing that fortune could have done for the young
widow was to throw difficulties in the way of her obtaining an
engagement. Had she found a “shop” immediately and gone out on tour
alone after those happy years of joint engagements the poignancy of her
solitude might have overwhelmed her. The battle for a livelihood kept
her from brooding.

But it was a battle through that icy winter, with the little pile of
sovereigns growing shorter and shorter every day and Nancy nearly
starving herself that Letizia might lack nothing.

“Some people burn coal as if it was paper,” Miss Fewkes sniffed. She
did not know that every half-hundredweight meant no lunch for her
lodger, and if she had, she would only have despised her for it.

“Nothing this morning, I’m afraid,” the agent would say. “But something
may be turning up next week. Two or three companies will be going out
presently. Look in again, Miss O’Finn. I’m not forgetting you. You
shall have a chance for the first suitable engagement on my books. Cold
weather, isn’t it? Wonderful how this frost holds. Good morning.”

Down one long flight of draughty stone stairs in Garrick Street. Up
another flight of tumbledown wooden stairs in Maiden Lane. Two hours’
wait in an icy room with nothing to warm one but the flaming posters
stuck on the walls.

“Ah, is that you, Miss O’Finn? I’m glad you looked in to-day. Mr.
Howard Smythe is taking out _The New Dress_. Have you seen it? Capital
little farce. There’s a part that might suit you.”

Any part would suit her, Nancy thought, for she was beginning to lose
hope of ever being engaged again.

“Look in this afternoon, Miss O’Finn, round about three. Mr. Howard
Smythe will be here then to interview a few ladies.”

Down the long flight of tumbledown wooden stairs and out past the
Adelphi stage-door into the Strand. What was the time? Half-past one.
Mrs. Kino was taking Letizia to the circus. Not worth while to go
home. She would find a tea-shop for lunch. A damp bun and a glass of
London milk. A greasy marble table, and opposite a hungry-eyed clerk
reading Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ while he eked
out his bun and glass of milk. The waitress, who had nine warts on
her fingers, flung down the skimpy bills with equal disdain for both
these customers. Outside, the roar of the Strand on the iron-bound air.
Inside, the rattle of plates and the harsh giggles of the waitresses.
Outside, the grey frozen sky. Inside, leathery poached eggs and
somebody arguing in a corner of the shop that he had ordered coffee.

“That is coffee,” said the waitress, tossing her head.

“Is it? Well, I must have meant tea.”

After lunch a walk along the Embankment to get warm. Gulls screaming
and quarrelling for the crusts that were being flung to them. Wretched
men and women freezing on the benches. Plane-trees hung with their
little black balls that stirred not in this immotionable and icy air.
Back to Maiden Lane, and up the tumbledown wooden stairs once more.
Another endless wait in the cold anteroom.

“Ah, good afternoon, Miss O’Finn. I’m sorry, but Mr. Howard Smythe has
filled up the vacancies in his cast. But if you look in again next
week, perhaps I shall have something that will suit you.”

“Anything will suit me,” Nancy sighed.

“Ah, but you won’t suit everything,” the agent laughed. “You’re so
tall, you know. The real tragedy queen, eh? And managers do not want
tragedy queens these days.”

“Och, damn it, don’t try to be funny,” Nancy burst out. “You know I’m
not a tragedy queen.”

“Sorry, I was only making a little joke.”

“Well, after a month of agents in this weather one loses one’s sense of
humour,” Nancy replied.

At home Nancy found Letizia in a tremendous state of excitement after
her visit to the circus which had concluded with an introduction to Mr.
Kino’s elephants.

“And I touched Jumbo’s trunk, muvver, and it was all hot. And he wagged
his tail. And Mrs. Jumbo opened her mouf as wide as that.”

Here Letizia endeavoured to give an elephantine yawn to illustrate her
story.

“Yes, she took to my elephants,” said Mr. Kino. “In fact, I was nearly
offering her an engagement to appear with them.”

Nancy laughed.

“No, I’m serious, Miss O’Finn. What do you say to three pounds a week?
And, of course, the missus and I would look after the kid as if she was
our own.”

“Och, no, it’s very sweet of you both, but I couldn’t give her up like
that.”

“Arthur’s joking about the performing part,” Mrs. Kino put in. “He
knows very well I wouldn’t let her do any performing. But we would like
to have her with us when we leave on Sunday week.”

“You’re leaving on Sunday week?” Nancy asked in alarm.

“Yes, we’re going out on a long tour.”

Nancy was terribly worried by the prospect of her fellow lodgers’
departure. It would mean asking Miss Fewkes to look after Letizia while
she was out. In her bedroom she counted over the money she had left.
Only seven pounds, and out of that there would be this week’s bill to
pay. Things _were_ getting desperate.

Until now Nancy had avoided meeting her father in London, because
she felt that she could not bear the scene he would be sure to play
over her widowhood. Her life with Bram was too real and wonderful for
histrionics. But matters were now so serious that she could not afford
to let her own intimate feelings stand in the way of getting work. Her
father might be able to help her to an engagement. He might even be
able to lend her a little money in case of absolute necessity.

So Nancy sent a note to the Piccadilly Theatre, where he was playing,
and three days later she received an answer from an address in Earl’s
Court to say that owing to severe illness he had had to resign his part
at the Piccadilly a week or two before. Would Nancy visit him, as he
was still too unwell to go out?

“Mr. O’Finn?” repeated the slatternly girl who opened the door. “Can
you see Mr. O’Finn? Who is it, please?”

“It’s his daughter, Miss O’Finn.”

The slatternly girl opened her eyes as wide as their sticky lids would
let her.

“He’s not expecting anybody this afternoon,” she muttered.

“He may not be expecting anybody this afternoon,” said Nancy sharply,
“but his daughter is not exactly anybody. He has been ill and I want to
see him.”

The slatternly girl evidently felt incapable of dealing with this
crisis, for she retreated to the head of the basement stairs, and
called down:

“Mrs. Tebbitt, here’s somebody wants to see Mr. O’Finn. Will you come
up and talk to her, please?”

A sacklike woman with a flaccid red face and sparse hair excavated
herself slowly from the basement.
